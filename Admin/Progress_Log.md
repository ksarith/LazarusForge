## Purpose

Created 2026-08-09 to fix a recurring failure mode found the same day, in two places at once: `Discovery.md` had a "Cross-Module Unknowns — Attention Required" table that was 19 versions stale (last refreshed at `Unknowns.md` v4.29 while the live file was at v4.48), and `Unknowns.md` itself had a "What v4.39 Means" section that had silently violated its own Size Management Rule 1 for nine consecutive version bumps — that rule requires the section to be retired and replaced every time a new version is cut, and nobody had been doing it. Both were narrative/progression content trapped inside structural index files, with no dedicated home and nothing forcing either to stay current.

**This file DOES:**
- Hold the rolling answer to "what did we just learn, what's currently open, what's next" — the thing `Unknowns.md`'s old "What vX.X Means" section tried to be, without a version number baked into the heading this time, so a new entry never requires renaming the section.
- Track recent completed work at a summary level, for continuity across sessions.

**This file does NOT:**
- Duplicate `Unknowns.md`'s Active Index — that remains the sole authoritative source for open unknowns; this file references IDs, never restates their full detail.
- Duplicate the five `*_Scope_Map.md` files' per-file scope content.
- Hold anything that belongs in a Resolution Log — file-specific change history stays in that file's own log, not here. This file is for cross-cutting lessons and session-level continuity, not a substitute for per-file logs.

**Size discipline, learned directly from what broke last time:** this section rotates. Keep the current entry plus the four most recent in full below; older entries move to `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md` in full, same split pattern already established for `Unknowns.md`/`Unknowns_Changelog.md`. No version number in any heading here — headings are dated, so nothing about adding a new entry ever requires editing an old one's title. This rotation rule was exercised for the first time the same day this file was created — see Resolution Log.

## Current Lessons

*(Most recent first. Rotate to `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md` once more than five entries accumulate.)*

### 2026-09-21 — MAQT §8.9 Handoff Schemas + §8.10 Friction Log added; `MAQT_Role_Cards_and_Cycle1_Task.md` filed as new companion
ChatGPT reviewed the Cycle 1 standalone pack Grok had drafted and identified one structural gap before running: the role cards defined agent jobs well but left handoffs as "transcript exchange" rather than structured artifacts — meaning agents would have to parse conversations to find review decisions rather than consuming filled forms. Grok added §8.9 (three handoff schemas: Planner→Skeptic/Auditor/Human, Skeptic→Auditor/Human, Auditor→Human — every field named, explicit non-claims on the Auditor form so GOV-008-not-advanced and GMP-004-not-resolved are stated per artifact rather than assumed) and §8.10 (Collaboration Friction Log — required block on every MAQT Field_Logs entry, covering context duplication, serialization, ambiguous handoff, role confusion, evidence retrieval, Git friction, human-intervention points, unexpected behavior, protocol bottlenecks, and proposed automation candidates). The explicit framing in §8.10's note is worth recording: independence and concurrency are separate goals; Cycle 1 prioritizes independence, and serialization pain goes in the friction log so later cycles can test recon/overlap without pretending the first run solved scale. The MAQT_Role_Cards_and_Cycle1_Task.md standalone companion file was also added to the repo as `Tests/MAQT_Role_Cards_and_Cycle1_Task.md` — contains individual role cards (each agent receives only its own), shared operator rules, Cycle 1 task, and the handoff schema forms. Indexed in Tst_Scope_Map.md, Routing.md, and Discovery.md. Grok's explicit disposition: no more doctrine ahead of Cycle 1 — run the trial and observe real friction before adding collaboration architecture.

### 2026-09-21 — EC-013 Gate_03 and Gate_06 descent sequences filed as Proposed/Placeholder (Path A)
Claude scoped both as real candidates (not scope-outs): Gate_03 is a short extension of §7 Emergency Shutdown; Gate_06 is a short extension of GF-007 hot-work shutdown. Grok drafted and filed both under Path A. Gate_03: governance-failure trigger while Reduction energized mid-cycle; stop → coast-down before open → scrubber for clearance unless Fire Event halt → isolate → air quality hold → human-auth restart; §7 safe state preserved. Gate_06: trigger while arc/hot-work active; de-energize arc → lockout → visual sweep (FA-002 radius) → ventilation under Layer A → cool-down/fire-watch → no unattended restart. Full 2026-09-18 candidate set now registered (5/5). `Unknowns.md` → v5.50. EC-013 tracker remains Open pending Human acceptance of set completeness / Skeptic pass; Blocking retained on all five. Human-directed.

---
### 2026-09-20 — EC-013 Gate_05 Spin Chamber descent sequence filed as Proposed/Placeholder (Path A)
Third per-process EC-013 implementation. Grok drafted and filed `Operations/Gate_05_Separation_Thermal.md` §EC-013 Descent Sequence under the same Path A pattern: trigger (governance failure while induction/melt/rotation active), ordered Layer-B steps (stop feed → stop rotation before cooling → ramp induction toward hot-idle → preserve containment → atmosphere/off-gas under Layer A rules → isolation), explicit respect for thermal doctrine (stop spin before cool; prefer hot-idle over full quench), Layer-A hard overrides (Fire Event / Air_Scrubber fire-vent-halt; runaway RPM / melt-breach paths). File State, Last Audit, Drift Indicators updated. `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` EC-013 gap-matrix Gate_05 row and Status note updated (three implementations filed). `Unknowns.md` advanced to v5.49. EC-013 tracker remains Open — Gate_03 / Gate_06 still lack sequences. Human-directed.

---
### 2026-09-20 — EC-013 Air_Scrubber descent sequence filed as Proposed/Placeholder (Path A)
Second per-process EC-013 implementation. Grok drafted and filed `Operations/Air_Scrubber.md` §EC-013 Descent Sequence under the same Path A pattern as Plastics: trigger (governance failure while scrubber is supporting a hazardous process), ordered Layer-B steps (signal upstream stop → preserve capture path → managed load reduction → sump/media check → ventilation mode decision under Layer A constraint → isolation), explicit Layer-A hard overrides (Fire Event → forced vent halt immediately; Fault 04; Thermal Fault; Acidic Ingress E-Stop), completion criteria, logging, non-goals. Fire-vent-halt is written as a hard override of any graceful airflow continuity step. File State, Last Audit, Drift Indicators updated. `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` EC-013 gap-matrix Air_Scrubber row and Status note updated. `Unknowns.md` advanced to v5.48. EC-013 tracker remains Open — Gate_05 / Gate_03 / Gate_06 still lack sequences. Human-directed.

---
### 2026-09-20 — EC-013 Plastics descent sequence filed as Proposed/Placeholder (Path A)
James directed Path A (EL-006-P3–P5 placeholder pattern). Grok drafted and filed `Operations/Plastics.md` §EC-013 Descent Sequence: trigger (governance failure while pyrolysis/reactor active), ordered Layer-B steps (stop feed → preserve containment → managed heat-down → off-gas path continuity → purge when safe → isolation), explicit Layer-A hard overrides (Air_Scrubber fire-vent-halt wins), completion criteria, logging requirements, and non-goals. Marked Proposed/Placeholder; Blocking for hot runs retained; no claim of EC-013 closure or physical validation. File State / Last Audit / Drift Indicators updated. `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` EC-013 sidecar gap-matrix row and Status note updated (Last Reviewed → 2026-09-20). `Unknowns.md` advanced to v5.47 with Active Index row reflecting the first registered sequence. EC-013 tracker remains Open — remaining candidate files (Air_Scrubber, Gate_05, Gate_03, Gate_06) still lack sequences. Human-directed.

---
### 2026-09-20 — `Tests/Multi_Agent_Quorum_Trial.md` §8 Preparation Package merged from Grok's standalone file
Grok produced a standalone `Multi_Agent_Quorum_Trial.md` with a §8 Preparation Package as a turnkey addition to the protocol created 2026-09-18. Compared against the existing repo file: §1–§7, File State, Scope Boundary, and headers were identical; §8 was new content that filled exactly what the original left open. Merged as §8 rather than keeping it standalone. Added: (1) recommended defaults for all open DECISION NEEDED items (shared remote for proposal passing, human-fixed rotation schedule before trial, Cycle 1 role map M1=Planner/M2=Skeptic/M3=Auditor, 300s liveness timeout, bounded non-constitutional task only); (2) fillable pre-trial worksheet covering baseline, roles, Git authority, probe selection, ratification plan, and failure scenario watch-list; (3) six concrete non-collusion probes ready to inject (stale status claim, incorrect file reference, false Hardware_Diversity_Ladder content claim, unsupported "Measured" threshold, attractive unconstitutional shortcut, document conflict that would falsely advance GOV-008); (4) ready-to-paste Field_Logs skeleton; (5) explicit minimal viable first-run configuration permitting logical-isolation-only as an honest interim measure per §VII.1 — records the limitation rather than pretending physical diversity exists. Last Reviewed updated 2026-09-18→2026-09-20; Tst_Scope_Map.md entry updated. Status unchanged: Proposed Protocol — Not Yet Run; no GOV-008 progress claimed.

## Forward Growth Avenues (2026-09-21)

**Supersedes the 2026-08-21 version** (full prior text preserved in
`Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md`). Strategic direction ratified by the Human Governing Authority following ChatGPT's operational-proving assessment (2026-09-21): the Forge has accumulated enough governance doctrine that the default question is no longer "what governance should we add?" but "what do we need to prove next, and what is the smallest real-world experiment that produces that evidence?" Three-lane structure replaces the prior Lane A/B/C/D/E taxonomy. Prior Lane A item list is archived in full.

### Lanes

| Lane | Name | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| **A** | **Make it work** | Multi-agent collaboration, execution harness, Git/worktrees, evidence handoffs, automated checks — the Forge's ability to operate as a system |
| **B** | **Make it true** | Physical tests, electronics, materials, fabrication, field measurements, empirical validation — mechanical truth that software review cannot supply |
| **C** | **Make it learn** | Unknowns, provenance, measurements, failure records, model revision, self-assessment metrics — the feedback loop that converts experience into knowledge |

The loop across all three lanes:

```
MAKE → TEST → MEASURE → LEARN → REVISE → MAKE
```

Governance construction remains available but is no longer the default next step. Each new governance pass must now justify itself against the question: does this produce evidence, or does it produce more doctrine about evidence?

---

### Lane A — highest near-term priority

**MAQT Cycle 1 (Multi-Agent Quorum Trial)**
Protocol file: `Tests/Multi_Agent_Quorum_Trial.md` · Companion: `Tests/MAQT_Role_Cards_and_Cycle1_Task.md`

Run Cycle 1 as a **requirements-discovery experiment**, not merely a quorum test. The output should not be "PASS/FAIL." It should be the requirements for the Forge's eventual multi-agent operating environment — which claims hold under three independent agents, which break, where the human remains indispensable, which governance rules need mechanical enforcement, which information must cross agent boundaries and in what form.

The §8.10 Collaboration Friction Log in the protocol file is the primary collection mechanism. Fill it honestly regardless of outcome. An informative failure is worth more than a smooth run that reveals nothing.

**Specification → mechanism inventory (ongoing)**
The Forge has accumulated many "The Forge shall..." claims. The next maturity step is "here is the mechanism that makes that true." Priority classification:

| Claim | Current state | Priority |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Agent cannot self-approve | Procedural | High — failure damages governance |
| Unknown cannot silently become resolved | Mostly procedural | High |
| Human retains canonical authority | Procedural | High |
| Repository integrity can be verified | Relatively mature | Medium |
| Agent identity is trustworthy | Incomplete | High — MAQT will surface this |
| Gates actually stop bad transitions | Needs testing | High — Lane B/C |
| Evidence must be provenance-backed | Partly mechanical | Medium |
| Quorum is independently established | Incomplete | MAQT is the test |

Note: `Unknowns.md` and every "Proposed/Placeholder" / "Payment via Specification" flag already constitutes this inventory in distributed form. What is missing is a compiled summary — a useful future artifact, not an urgent gap.

**Residual governance work** — do surgically as surfaced, not as a campaign:
- GMP-011 (Track classification dispute, In Progress — strongest remaining pure-spec candidate)
- FL-006 half B (authority/GOV-006 dependency — still blocked, still correct to leave parked)
- EC-012 procedural escalation rule (drafted, unfiled — needs ratification decision when ready)
- GOV-007 Q2–Q4 (remaining Genesis Phase decisions — answerable against the specified boundary; low urgency until site conditions change)

---

### Lane B — physical experiments (parallel, not deferred)

Physical experimentation should run in parallel with governance and collaboration work, not wait for governance to be "finished." The Forge's ultimate claim is not that it can write excellent Markdown — it is that it can help produce physical capability.

**What can move before FA-001 site confirmation:**
- Electronics admission testing: Logic-Zero / hash verification on actual salvaged components (EL-006 v0 floor, already specified)
- Small material characterization: sorting and identification against `Architecture/Chemistry.md` and `Architecture/Components.md` classes
- MAQT trial itself (the first physical instantiation of multi-agent operation)

**What waits on FA-001:** hot pyrolysis, molten-metal operations, EC-013 hot-run validation, gate cycle on real material (the melt-down/re-fabrication that would constitute the first "demonstrated" Forge instance per GOV-007 Decision 5).

A fabricated part either works or it doesn't. Field log entries against real material will do more for the Forge's credibility than any number of additional specification passes.

---

### Lane C — feedback and measurement

The Forge should become capable of auditing its own effectiveness without simply declaring itself effective. Currently underdeveloped relative to Lane A and B work.

**Development metrics (not yet tracked):**
- Time from question → usable proposal
- Review cycles per change
- Rejected proposals vs accepted
- Discovered contradictions / stale references
- Human intervention count per cycle
- Agent-generated defects caught vs missed

**Governance metrics (partially tracked via Unknowns.md):**
- Unknowns opened / resolved / falsely closed and caught
- Policy/procedure conflicts discovered

**Physical metrics (pending Lane B activity):**
- Predicted vs measured performance
- Material efficiency, failure rate, repairability

**Knowledge/evidence substrate (longer-horizon):**
The future problem is not "can an AI read the repository?" It is "can an AI reliably determine what is actually known?" The Forge needs increasingly strong separation between: FACT / MEASUREMENT / OBSERVATION / INFERENCE / ASSUMPTION / PROPOSAL / UNKNOWN / DECISION / AUTHORIZATION. This naturally complements existing provenance and epistemic-labeling discipline.

---

### Explicit non-work (updated)

- Treating more governance as the default next step without justification
- Bulk pseudo-audits of Admin files with no driving question
- Closing GOV-021c, GOV-005, or GOV-007 Q2–Q4 on specification alone
- Inventing numeric thresholds without Field_Logs data
- Spec Gate campaigns on Exploration files with empty Field_Logs
- Letting security architecture (EL-006 / SEC-007b) expand beyond evidence-driven grounded probes
- Treating an agent summary as source without checking the sidecar first
- More collaboration doctrine ahead of running Cycle 1 — the protocol is ready, the next move is the run

---

### Prior Lane A candidate list

The prior verified Lane A funnel (2026-08-21/30, confirmed GMP-006/007/008/010/011/012, CLF-011, GMP-013, and the full reclassification table) is preserved in full in `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md` under the **2026-08-21 Forward Growth Avenues** section. Items from that list still relevant: GMP-011 (In Progress, lowest-friction remaining spec candidate), CLF-011 §4b contract ratification.



## Resolution Log

- 2026-09-10: Added 2026-09-09/10 lesson to Current Lessons covering
  HP-011/013/014, FL-002/005/006/007, GR-009/MG-009 (including the
  Gate_04 duplicate Resolution Log fix), the Gate_02 TIL extension,
  and the Gate_06 WAAM/LPBF language update. Rotated 2026-09-03/04
  (eleven-file audit campaign) into
  `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md` to keep Current Lessons
  at five entries. Last Reviewed updated. Human-directed.

- 2026-09-08: Added 2026-09-08/09 Forge_flow.md refinement lesson to
  Current Lessons (Open Maintenance Task from a Grok integrity-report
  review, flagging this file's Last Reviewed as stale at 2026-09-06
  with no lesson covering the session's Forge_flow consolidations —
  checked and confirmed accurate). Rotated 2026-09-02 (Auditor_Protocols
  self-audit) into `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md` to keep
  Current Lessons at five entries. Last Reviewed updated. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-20: **AP-004 (cross-auditor disagreement resolution) Resolved
  — Payment via Specification, ratified by the Human Governing Authority.** Grok proposed (with
  a self-produced Revision 1 addressing three amendments from a prior
  ChatGPT review); Grok again correctly declined to self-verify — second
  consecutive instance of that pattern; ChatGPT served as independent
  Verifier, Pass. Full Closure Event in
  `Archive/Logs/Auditor_Protocols_Logs.md`'s AP-004 sidecar entry. Four
  residuals (AP-004-R1–R4) remain open as non-blocking child notes.

- 2026-08-20: **AP-024 (human attestation provenance) Resolved —
  Payment via Specification, ratified by the Human Governing Authority.** ChatGPT proposed,
  Grok performed a pre-integration Skeptic/Evidence pass, Claude
  integrated with an added H0–H5 reconciliation note, and Copilot —
  first genuinely uninvolved Verifier used in this campaign, needed
  because ChatGPT/Grok/Claude were all entangled — independently
  verified, Pass. A separate Gemini response fabricated an entire
  alternate specification rather than reading the real one; identified
  and excluded from the ratification basis, not weighed as input. Full
  Closure Event in `Archive/Logs/Auditor_Protocols_Logs.md`'s AP-024
  sidecar entry. Five residuals (AP-024-R1–R5) remain open as
  non-blocking child notes.

- 2026-08-20: **GOV-014, GOV-016, GOV-020 (governance complexity
  ceiling, pruning doctrine, cost metric) all Resolved — Payment via
  Specification, ratified by the Human Governing Authority in one batch.** First unknowns
  closed under the AP-013 doctrine outside `Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md`.
  Grok proposed all three; ChatGPT independently verified all three
  together (Pass on GOV-014 and GOV-016; Pass on GOV-020 contingent on
  correcting a real arithmetic error — 29/83≈0.35 misdescribed as "well
  below" the 0.30 Watch threshold when it actually sits inside that
  band — corrected before ratification). Full Closure Events in
  `Archive/Logs/Governance_Charter_Changelog.md`'s GOV-014, GOV-016, and
  GOV-020 sidecar entries. Ten residuals across the three (GOV-014-R1–
  R3, GOV-016-R1–R3, GOV-020-R1–R4) remain open as non-blocking child
  notes.

- 2026-08-21: **GOV-022 (reversibility as cross-cutting operating
  principle) Resolved — Payment via Specification, ratified by the Human Governing Authority.**
  Fourth unknown closed in the GOV-014/016/020/022 wave, and the only
  one where Claude was Proposer rather than Grok — drafted directly at
  the human governing authority's request, after being asked whether
  Gate_03_Reduction.md already articulated reversibility well. Source investigation found
  the principle independently reinvented three times (Gate_03, the
  Discharge Procedure, the Epistemic Ledger) with zero cross-linking to
  each other or to Axiom P-1/Q-3 — evidence against the "reject as
  redundant" option both Grok and ChatGPT had initially favored.
  ChatGPT served as Verifier, Pass across eight dimensions, explicitly
  reversing its own prior recommendation once the investigation was
  available and asking that reversal be preserved as Lessons Learned
  rather than smoothed over. Full Closure Event in
  `Archive/Logs/Governance_Charter_Changelog.md`'s GOV-022 sidecar
  entry.

- 2026-08-21: **Progress_Log restructure — closure backlog recorded,
  Forward Growth Avenues rebuilt Lane-first, six candidate items
  reverified against source.** The five closures above were written
  into this log for the first time (see 2026-08-21 Current Lessons
  entry — they sat unrecorded across the 2026-08-20/21 ratification
  session). Two external "what's left" summaries (ChatGPT, Grok) were
  checked against source rather than adopted directly: found GOV-022
  already Resolved (both summaries described it as still needing
  drafting) and GOV-003 dependency-blocked on GOV-008 via
  `Admin/Security_Protocols.md` Phase 3 (one summary listed it as a
  live target). Forward Growth Avenues (2026-08-14) replaced with a
  2026-08-21 version restructured Lane-first per the human governing
  authority's standing directive to prioritize closure work not dependent
  on real-world/hardware tests; prior text preserved in
  `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md`. Six candidate items
  (TS-002, GI-002, GF-007, CE-006, GOV-003, GOV-005) verified against
  their own sidecars: four (TS-002, GI-002, GF-007, CE-006) had already
  advanced past Lane A into Lane C/D since 2026-08-15 and were not
  re-flagged by the frozen section; GOV-003 and GOV-005 confirmed
  Lane D/E respectively. Verified Lane A set: PL-001, WA-002, GOV-015,
  GOV-018. Current Lessons: two new 2026-08-21 entries added. A prior
  implementation pass had also dropped three legitimate 2026-08-16
  entries (GitHub MIT badge fix, License boundary cleanup, Tag naming
  convention) above this file's own `#` header, outside any section —
  restored to their correct place in Current Lessons here. 2026-08-14,
  2026-08-12, 2026-08-11/12, and both 2026-08-09 entries rotated to
  `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md` in full (Current Lessons now
  holds the 7 entries dated 2026-08-16 or later; same-day entries were
  not further pruned to force an exact count of 5 — see note below).
  Last Reviewed → 2026-08-21. No unknowns created or closed by this
  entry itself — purely a continuity/lane-verification and correction
  pass. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-21: **Correction pass on the entry above.** Verification against
  the uploaded repository found the prior pass's Current Lessons rotation
  had not actually been executed (the two oldest 2026-08-09 entries were
  still present, not yet appended to the changelog), and that three
  legitimate 2026-08-16 entries had been relocated above this file's own
  document header — outside Current Lessons, outside any section —
  rather than integrated into it. Both corrected: all four entries older
  than 2026-08-16 (2026-08-14, 2026-08-12, 2026-08-11/12, 2026-08-09 ×2)
  moved to `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md` verbatim; the three
  orphaned 2026-08-16 entries restored into Current Lessons in their
  proper position. Current Lessons now holds 7 entries (2× 2026-08-21,
  5× 2026-08-16) rather than exactly 5 — same-day entries were kept
  rather than arbitrarily dropped, since the file's own rotation rule
  doesn't specify intra-day ordering; flagged here rather than resolved
  by guessing which of five same-date entries to cut. Also corrected an
  awkward doubled self-reference in the GOV-022 Resolution Log entry
  introduced by name-scrubbing ("the human governing authority's request
  after the human governing authority asked" → "the human governing
  authority's request, after being asked"). Human-directed.

- 2026-08-14: **Progress_Log refresh after FN-001/FN-005 spec-complete bump.**
  Forward Growth Avenues (2026-08-12) replaced with 2026-08-14 version;
  prior text preserved in `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md`.
  Current Lessons: new entry on the continuity gap itself (this file lagged
  Unknowns v4.55 and the Field_Logs Second-Highest-Value Run); oldest
  2026-08-09 "Progression content trapped…" entry rotated to changelog.
  Last Reviewed → 2026-08-14. No unknowns created or closed. Verified
  against source before writing: FN-001/FN-005 remain Open (calibration
  only), CLF-011 remains Open with stubs present, GOV-021c still the sole
  ADP ratification blocker. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-12: **CLF-011 reconciled onto CLF-010-ratified baseline.** Prior Grok
  pass used pre-ratification tree (reported 10→11, CLF-010 Open) — incorrect
  starting point. Correct arithmetic: after CLF-010 Resolve, Open was 9; +CLF-011
  → **10**. `fir_class` rename applied here without reopening CLF-010. Human-directed.


- 2026-08-11: **GOV-021c specification draft** applied on Alpha10-updated4
  baseline (`Admin/Autonomy_Divergence_Protocol.md` §12). GOV-021b already
  Resolved in this tree; only GOV-021c remains open. Detection-only; EQD
  independence dimensions + FN-001 principles; no numeric thresholds;
  Astroid-miner 80–99% not adopted. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-10: **Claude-review follow-up batch applied.** (1) **AS-004

  field; same pattern as TS-002/EL-005/GI-002. (2) **SEC-007a** left Blocking
  No (constitutional; agent may not resolve unilaterally); deferred to
  Facilities.md §VII Deferred governance parameters + back-link from
  SEC-007a Resolution Path. (3) **Priority (Promo)** defined in
  `Admin/Canonical_Terms.md` — separates Unknowns.md promotion-blocking
  column from file-local operational Blocking; clarifies F-SC-003 and
  EV-001 false-positive desyncs. Human-directed (Claude draft, Grok apply).

  CLF: Open Unknowns 10 = CLF-001–010; CLF-003/004 Critical correctly Open
  (CLF-004 blocked on CE-006); CLF-006/009 In Progress consistent. Spec Gates

  Same limits. SEC: Open Unknowns 13 match; SEC-001 Blocking Yes correct;
  SEC-007a Critical + highest-order failure language vs Blocking No logged
  for human review (not auto-flipped — constitutional domain). ME: Open
  Unknowns 4 match; no Blocking understatement of operational-safety type.
  Spec Gates left locked (0/6 and 2/6). No SEC-*/ME-* closed. Findings in

  Facilities/Electronics. EN: Open Unknowns 7 = EN-001–007; EN-001 correctly
  Blocking Yes/Critical (no understatement); Spec Gates left 3/6. WA: Open
  Unknowns 4 = WA-001–004; WA-002/WA-004 correctly Critical; removed stale

  closed. Findings F-EN-001–003, F-WA-001–003 in file Resolution Logs.
  Human-directed.

- 2026-08-10: **Rule 10 (AP-035) added to Auditor_Protocols.md.** External
  Pseudo-Audit Scope and Logging Destination. Triggered by a Gemini
  pseudo-audit that fabricated an Archive/ inventory count (claimed 7,
  actual 27) and proposed three unregistered unknown IDs in a freestanding
  "Systemic Unknowns Ledger." Claude correctly diagnosed the fabrication
  pattern (third instance of the same failure class after two prior
  Copilot incidents). Grok verified file counts and ID collision-check
  (AP-035 free), then applied the rule. Spec Gates and Open Unknowns
  count on Auditor_Protocols unchanged. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-10: **Integrity cleanup pass (post-Alpha inspection).** (1) Repaired
  six broken relative links that had existed in historical copies under
  `Archive/Logs/` (paths that resolved inside Archive/ instead of repo root);
  those two historical copies were then retired as pure duplicates of the
  live `Admin/Progress_Log.md` and `Archive/Rename_Registry.md`. (2) Added
  explicit Template Exemptions section to `Admin/File_Template.md` so future
  retrofit passes do not force the full template onto Archive/, root navigation
  surface, scope maps, changelogs, BATTERY_SEED, PROBE_INVOCATION, or
  Automation sources. (3) Applied standard Navigation Anchors only to
  non-exempt active doctrine files that were missing them (Auditor_Protocols,
  Canonical_Terms, Economics, Forge_Audit_Kit, Repository_Structure,
  Safety_Protocols, Precision). (4) Documented in `Routing.md` that the table
  is intentionally the *active operational* map and that Archive/ exclusion
  is by design, not drift. Zero broken relative links remaining; zero
  non-exempt files missing Navigation Anchors. Human-directed; deliberately
  small scope — no governance rewrite.

- 2026-08-10: **Discovery changelog migration integrated.** Installed
  `Archive/Logs/Discovery_Changelog.md` (PC-008 — correction-note history
  migrated out of Discovery.md); updated Discovery.md + Routing.md from
  migration package. Re-applied post-migration: Verification_Gates.md
  (not `_LF`); Admin tree `.md` suffixes + CIR_Gov/Autonomy entries;
  Archive/Logs list includes Progress_Log_Changelog + Discovery_Changelog;
  Routing Rename Registry pointer stays on `Archive/Rename_Registry.md`.
  Progress_Log gained lesson "newly-fixed pattern / live instance next
  door"; rotated 2026-08-06/07 blanket-Resolved lesson (already in
  changelog). Human-directed merge with conflict resolution against
  prior correction-pass state.

- 2026-08-10: **Facilities + Electronics pseudo-audits.** Same role limits.
  FA: Owner path prefixed `Architecture/Facilities.md`; FA-001 remains
  Critical/Blocking (physical site). EL: EL-005 Blocking No → Yes (PPE/
  scrubber sufficiency unknown per own Why It Matters). Open counts
  verified (FA 4, EL 9). Spec Gates unchanged (both 0/6). Findings
  F-FA-001–003, F-EL-001–004 in file Resolution Logs. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **Ethical_Constraints + Gate_02_Triage pseudo-audits.** Same
  role limits. EC: nav URLs → refs/heads/main; EC-010 Status → In Progress
  (aligned with ENV-003 vehicle + Unknowns.md). G2: TS-002 Blocking No →
  Yes (file's own highest-risk/operator-harm language + Unknowns index).
  No Spec Gate changes (EC 0/6, G2 2/6). No EC-*/TS-* closures. Open counts
  verified (EC 16, G2 7). Findings F-EC-001–003, F-G2-001–004 in file
  Resolution Logs. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **Energy.md pilot pseudo-audit.** Role: Skeptic/Auditor
  (read) + Synthesizer (minimal in-repo fixes). Corrections: EV-001
  Blocking `EC-002` → `ECN-002`; Safety Advisory session-relative language
  dated. Findings F-EN-001/002/003 logged in file Resolution Log (Spec
  Gates 1/6 soft evidence; Unknowns Priority vocabulary overload;
  EGL still proposed). No Spec Gate change. No EV-* closed. Confirmed
  Air_Scrubber Variant 0 cross-ref valid; Open Unknowns 5 = EV-001–005.
  Human-directed pilot of self-audit limits.

- 2026-08-09: **ChatGPT-pass reconciliation + RS-002 close + VG Track A +
  dual-file clarify + Unknowns sweep.** (1) Accepted clean AUDIT_HARNESS
  Rename Registry pointer; rewrote Engineer_Protocols and RIP pointers
  without ChatGPT's over-substitution errors. (2) RS-002 closed as accepted
  outlier (`Forge_flow.md` casing) — matches Rename Registry 2026-06-11
  resolution. (3) Track A: `Verification_Gates_LF.md` → `Verification_Gates.md`
  across entire tree; Rename Registry row added. (4) Engineering.md Rename
  Registry row corrected from "replaced by" to "spawned peer" —
  Mechanical_Structures.md is live peer, both Scope Boundaries agree.
  (5) Unknowns Priority/Blocking sweep: ~313 Open; Priority column mixes
  promo ranks (Critical/Major/Minor), Blocking, and High/Medium/Low —
  Canonical Terms distinguishes Operational vs Epistemic Blocking but the
  index column has no enforced vocabulary; empty Priority on Candidate/
  Deferred clusters and some long-form Status cells. Documented, not
  mass-rewritten (would invent doctrine). Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **Architecture question answered; Discovery tree hygiene only.**
  Explicit check: no architectural changes required by system doctrine.
  Six-folder structure (ASM-001) stable; CIR/CIR_Gov correctly Proposed–Not
  Ratified under Charter; no folder merge/split/new-domain trigger fired.
  Work limited to navigation integrity: Discovery structure tree missing
  `.md` suffixes on two Admin entries, omitted `CIR_Gov.md` and
  `Autonomy_Divergence_Protocol.md` (present in Maturity Snapshot but not
  tree), and omitted `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md`. Corrected
  against filesystem; correction note added. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **Scope Boundary closure + RS-002 framing.** Conforming
  Scope Boundary sections added to `Computational_Institutional_Reasoning.md`
  and `Nothingness_Theorem.md` (the two files flagged as missing any scope
  statement on Adm_Scope_Map creation); `Autonomy_Divergence_Protocol.md`'s
  narrative "## 2. Scope" normalized to the standard DOES/DOES NOT template.
  All three Adm_Scope_Map entries and the Gaps Exposed section updated —
  findings 1–3 closed. RS-002 (`Forge_flow.md` casing) reframed as
  "Awaiting human decision" after discovering an internal contradiction
  between Repository_Structure's PascalCase recommendation and the
  2026-06-11 resolution log / Rename Registry that already treated the
  current form as canonical; no rename performed. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **Post-migration pointer and registration-lag pass.** After
  integrating the Progress-Log migration package, residual "Discovery.md
  Rename Registry" pointers remained in `Routing.md`, `Admin/Canonical_Terms.md`
  (3 sites), and `Architecture/Forge_flow.md`. All corrected to
  `Archive/Rename_Registry.md`. Separately, RS-003 ("Archive/ directory not
  yet physically created") was still Open in both `Repository_Structure.md`
  and the `Unknowns.md` Active Index despite Archive/ having been present
  and populated for an extended period and RIP-001 having closed 2026-06-27.
  Closed on recognition; File State Open Unknowns count on
  `Repository_Structure.md` adjusted 3 → 2. Classic registration lag —
  physical condition satisfied long before the index caught up. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **Rotation rule exercised for the first time, same day as file
  creation.** Adding the "even this file's own creation caught a live
  instance" entry brought the total to six, past the stated five-entry
  cap. Oldest entry (2026-08-01/02) rotated to the new
  `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md`, verbatim, nothing altered.
  Also fixed while verifying this file: `Unknowns.md`'s main block was
  still carrying v4.46 and v4.47's full text after both had already been
  safely copied to `Unknowns_Changelog.md` — the "keep only current
  version" rule had gone unenforced across two version bumps. Removed
  the duplicates from `Unknowns.md` directly; nothing was lost, both
  versions were already intact in the changelog. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **File created.** Absorbs the function of `Unknowns.md`'s retired
  "What v4.39 Means" section (migrated as the fifth entry above) and replaces
  `Discovery.md`'s removed "Cross-Module Unknowns — Attention Required" table,
  which was deleted outright rather than migrated — `Unknowns.md`'s own Active
  Index with Priority/Blocking columns already serves that exact function
  without a shadow copy. See `Discovery.md` and `Unknowns.md`'s own Resolution
  Log / correction-note entries, same date, for the removal side of this
  change. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-10: **Archive/ reclassified into Snapshots/Logs/Transcripts.** Human-
  directed downtime cleanup, separate from the pseudo-audit cycle. Archive/
  root's stated Purpose (file-version snapshots) never matched most of its
  actual contents (raw external-agent chat transcripts). (1) Deleted 3
  transcript files with zero inbound references anywhere in the repo
  (Quorum-Copilot.md, Grok-8Aug.md, ADP-Copilot.md). (2) Moved the 15
  remaining transcripts — all cited by name in Resolution Logs or doctrine
  files — to new `Archive/Transcripts/`; updated every citing reference
  (Routing.md, Auditor_Protocols.md, Ethical_Constraints.md,
  Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md, Closed_Loop_Feedstock.md, and
  Unknowns_Changelog.md) to the new path; zero dangling references remain.
  (3) Removed `ForgeFlowchart.png` (1.9MB, ~30% of repo size) — confirmed
  zero references anywhere in the repo before removal. (4) Rewrote
  `Archive/README.md`'s Purpose section to accurately describe all three
  subdirectories (root/Logs/Transcripts) instead of only the root's
  original, now-inaccurate, snapshot-only description. `Archive/Logs/` and
  `Archive/Rename_Registry.md` untouched. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **Automated morning report found running one push-cycle
  behind live state.** Grok's daily repository report (auto-run each
  morning against GitHub `main` via raw.githubusercontent.com) reported
  Routing.md at 111 entries / "Last updated 2026-08-09" and Unknowns.md at
  v4.48/2026-08-09, with no trace of 2026-08-10's work: Rule 10 (AP-035),
  the 40-pseudo-audit cycle (6 Blocking flips: TS-002, EL-005, GI-002,
  AS-004, FN-001, FN-005), or the Archive/ → Snapshots/Logs/Transcripts
  reclassification. Confirmed against local verified copy (Routing.md: 123
  entries, dated 2026-08-10; Rule 10 present in `Auditor_Protocols.md`) —
  the report's content was accurate for the state it actually read, just a
  full day stale relative to the push. No fabrication found; this is the
  same desync class as the 2026-07-27 six-week gap and the resurrected
  duplicate-file incident, just caught same-day this time because the
  report runs automatically every morning. **Standing caution:** verify
  the morning report's freshness (Routing.md's own "Last updated" string)
  against the last known local push date before treating its contents as
  current state. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **`Repository_Structure.md` updated to formalize Automation/
  (external ChatGPT review finding, verified before applying).** Section
  II's folder diagram and Decision Rules listed only six folders and had
  no rule for Automation/, though it exists physically (9 scripts) and is
  already treated as its own layer in both `Routing.md` and `Discovery.md`
  — those two were already correct; this file was the one lagging. Added
  Automation/ to the diagram plus a new Rule 8: infrastructure, not a
  seventh content domain, no `*_Scope_Map.md`, doctrine about automation
  still goes to Admin/ under Rule 1. Two other ChatGPT findings reviewed
  and not applied this pass: `Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md`'s
  historical Archive/Git-tag material is already properly dated within
  RIP-001's own Resolution Log entry (2026-06-27), not free-floating
  undated text — lower urgency than flagged. A parallel Gemini review
  (Vector 1) repeated two already-resolved claims as new top-priority
  work (CIR and Nothingness_Theorem missing Scope Boundary sections) —
  both checked and confirmed already present; not applied, since there
  was nothing to apply. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **EC-002 (Anti-Weaponization pattern-matching mechanism)
  resolved.** Human-directed request to close a specific Blocking unknown.
  Added a Pattern Recognition Annex to `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md`'s
  Anti-Weaponization Doctrine, built on the 2026-07-26-ratified
  intent/complicity principle: six pattern categories (stated harmful
  purpose, effect-first specification, anti-personnel targeting geometry,
  weapon-specific integration, concealment, circumvention of a prior
  refusal), a detection method hooked to `Operations/Gate_02_Triage.md`
  Station 0, false-positive handling scoped to incomplete specification
  with a one-round resolve-or-escalate rule, and a category-tagged
  escalation path into the Human Escalation Protocol. Plasma cutter
  paradox resolved as the worked example. EC-002 sidecar entry Open →
  Resolved; `Ethical_Constraints.md` Open Unknowns 16 → 15; version bumped
  0.11 → 0.14 (also correcting a stale Version field that had not tracked
  two prior bumps). `Unknowns.md` Active Index EC-002 row removed per Size
  Management Rule 2; `Unknowns_Changelog.md` given a new v4.49 entry.
  `Operations/Gate_02_Triage.md` ASM-006 updated in step — its Expiry
  Trigger had fired now that EC-002 has a defined mechanism; Confidence
  raised Low → Medium, not higher, since the Annex is unvalidated against
  live triage volume. Explicitly does not resolve EC-001 (confidence
  threshold) or EC-012 (telemetry spoofing) — both cross-referenced as
  separate, still-open dependencies. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **EC-001 (Confidence Threshold Doctrine) resolved.**
  Human-directed follow-on to EC-002's closure the same day. Added
  Confidence Threshold Doctrine to `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` Core
  Mandate, hooking `Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md` §AP-006's existing
  UNKNOWN/PROVISIONAL/VERIFIED epistemic-state machinery rather than
  inventing a new threshold system: High-Risk actions require VERIFIED,
  Medium/Low-Risk actions may proceed at PROVISIONAL with Analogous
  External or stronger provenance, UNKNOWN is never sufficient at any
  Risk level. Checked the Resolution Path's one-standard-vs-scale
  question directly: "confidently classified" and "reasonably bounded"
  were found live nowhere in the repository outside one archived Copilot
  transcript, narrowing the actual scope to defining "sufficient
  confidence" alone. Assessment method reuses AP-006's existing
  calibration table and AP-004 arbitration rather than a new dispute
  path. EC-001 sidecar Open → Resolved; `Ethical_Constraints.md` Open
  Unknowns 15 → 14, version 0.14 → 0.15. `Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md`
  §AP-006 given a light reverse cross-reference to EC-001 (logged in
  `Archive/Logs/Auditor_Protocols_Logs.md` v0.38, no doctrine content
  changed there). `Unknowns.md` Active Index EC-001 row removed per Size
  Management Rule 2; v4.50 entry added, v4.49 rotated to
  `Unknowns_Changelog.md`. Explicitly does not resolve LT-003 (autonomy
  architecture), EC-008 (inferred authorization), or EC-012 (telemetry
  spoofing) — all cross-referenced as separate, still-open dependencies.
  Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **Autonomy_Divergence_Protocol.md's first Skeptic/Auditor
  dual-pass run (Claude), triggered by a proposed ratification.** Result:
  5/6 Spec Gates PASSED, G5 (Cross-Reference Integrity) BLOCKED on three
  unqualified Astroid-miner filenames. Fixed same day: all 8 occurrences
  qualified with `[Astroid-miner]`, and a §6/§9 semantic-drift wording fix
  (Human-Reviewed tier menu now points at §9's formal Restoration
  Procedure instead of implying restoration happens from the menu
  directly). Ratification was explicitly **not** applied — deferred
  pending G5 re-verification, with GOV-021b and GOV-021c still Open.
  Cross-checked independent ChatGPT and Gemini reviews of the same audit
  run first: both engaged with the real question (is Exploration-stage
  incompleteness appropriately bounded rather than hidden) rather than
  fabricating findings; Copilot correctly declined to audit from harness
  output alone without the actual file text, rather than guessing — a
  clean instance of the discipline AP-035 was written to encourage.
  Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **G5 fix from the entry above was incomplete — corrected
  same day.** A follow-up Skeptic/Auditor pass (Claude) caught that the
  Resolution Log entry written to document the original G5 fix itself
  used bare backtick-wrapped filenames to describe the bug, re-tripping
  the exact harness check it was documenting as resolved. Confirmed by
  running `audit_lib.py`'s actual extraction regex directly against the
  file rather than trusting prose claims either way — this is the second
  time in this thread that verifying a claim by execution rather than
  reading caught something reading alone missed. Fixed: removed the
  remaining bare occurrences; re-ran the regex directly, zero bare
  matches remain. G5 is now genuinely resolved at the tooling level. Also
  applied from the same audit pass: EF-0.1 wording fix (two instances of
  "evidence the structure is sound" — an agent-convergence-as-verification
  framing EF-0.1 disqualifies — reworded to "corroborating design signal,
  not verification"), and a Semantic Drift clarification (File State now
  explains why Spec Gates/Governance ID are tracked ahead of formal
  Candidate-Spec promotion, rather than leaving that as an unexplained
  mismatch). **Not yet done:** the `[Astroid-miner]` bracket convention
  works only because of an undocumented substring-match exemption already
  in `audit_lib.py` — it isn't registered anywhere as a real convention
  (Routing.md, Discovery.md, Canonical_Terms.md). Worth formalizing before
  it's relied on again elsewhere. Ratification remains explicitly
  deferred — GOV-021b and GOV-021c still Open. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **G5 confirmed genuinely PASS — ran the real harness
  functions directly, not another manual replication.** Imported
  `parse_routing`, `extract_md_refs`, `check_cross_refs` straight from
  `Automation/audit_lib.py` and ran them against
  `Admin/Autonomy_Divergence_Protocol.md` using the local `Routing.md`
  (112 entries) and real `ALIASES` dict (18 entries) — bypassing only the
  network fetch, which pulls identical content. Zero findings. Spec Gates
  now 6/6. Registered the `[ExternalRepo]` convention in
  `Admin/Canonical_Terms.md` — caught and corrected a backwards mechanism
  description in my own first draft of that registration before it went
  into doctrine (verified by direct regex test, not assumption). Folded
  the EF-0.1 wording-fix tracking into GOV-021b's scope rather than
  leaving it as an unlogged loose end. Ratification remains correctly
  withheld pending GOV-021b/GOV-021c, which are now the only remaining
  blockers — gate and tooling status are fully resolved. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **GOV-021b Resolved — Grok's draft for §4 Detection Criteria
  applied after verification.** Checked before applying: AP-006's
  UNKNOWN/PROVISIONAL/VERIFIED states are real (confirmed in
  `Forge_Audit_Kit.md`) and EC-001's Confidence Threshold Doctrine matches
  the draft's description exactly — no invented machinery. Applied in
  full: 5 trigger categories, corroboration rules, 72h observation
  window, tier/epistemic-state mapping, entry thresholds, degraded-
  observation handling, and Watch exit conditions (4 paths) in §6. GOV-021c
  is now the sole remaining blocker on ratification, alongside the
  Constitutional Impact Statement still owed to
  `Governance_Migration_Protocol.md`. Also fixed while in `Unknowns.md`:
  the GOV-021 row was stale on a second, unrelated count — still claimed
  the ID itself was unregistered, though it was registered in the Charter
  sidecar back on 2026-07-27 (flagged as a known residual inconsistency
  several turns ago, fixed now rather than left open further). Caught and
  corrected my own process error while editing: initially left both the
  new v4.51 and the old v4.50 entries live in `Unknowns.md`'s header
  block, violating the file's own current-version-only rule; also found
  v4.50 had never actually been migrated to
  `Archive/Logs/Unknowns_Changelog.md` despite v4.49 already being
  properly migrated — added it there before removing it from the live
  file, so no history was lost. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **Data-loss caught and fixed: the Constitutional Impact
  Statement filed earlier today was silently deleted by Grok's GOV-021c
  editing pass, undisclosed in that pass's summary.** Verified by diffing
  against the last confirmed-good local copy before accepting the
  upload — zero matches anywhere in the file for the Impact Statement's
  actual content (P-4/Q-2 analysis, the counterfactual test, the
  checklist) after the GOV-021c pass, plus this file's own Progress_Log
  entry describing it was also gone. Likely cause: the Impact Statement
  section and the old §12 stub sat back-to-back between the same
  divider and the "Relationship to Prior Framing" header; the edit's
  target boundary appears to have swallowed both rather than just §12.
  Restored the full section verbatim, plus this entry, before doing
  anything else with the upload. GOV-021c's own content was verified
  separately and is being evaluated on its merits, unaffected by this
  fix. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **First item ratified purely on documentation-completeness
  grounds: CLF-010 (Closed_Loop_Feedstock.md §4a).** Surveyed the whole
  repo for genuinely ready-to-ratify items before picking this one —
  checked CIR_Gov.md (explicitly sequenced behind GOV-008, which needs
  physical hardware not yet available — correctly stays Proposed) and
  confirmed ADP itself still has a real open blocker (GOV-021c) plus an
  Impact Statement needing independent review, not just acceptance.
  CLF-010's own text was the one candidate that explicitly said it
  needed no physical trial — a bookkeeping rule, not a numeric
  recalibration. Verified the actual proposal before ratifying: formula
  internally consistent, cited CT-011 real (not fabricated), gaming-
  surface countermeasure sound. Ratified in full: four-class FIR
  taxonomy (A/B/C/D) plus Class D Residency Cap. Open Unknowns 10 → 9;
  Unknowns.md updated to match. Flagged, not done: Gate_04/05/06
  `material_class` field implementation unverified; Discovery.md's FIR
  maturity notes not yet updated. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-12: **GOV-021c decision packet resolved — accepted as written,
  held Open pending live evidence; CIS routed to independent audit.**
  Checked against a five-point checklist plus the CIS's next step, cross-
  verified against independent ChatGPT and Gemini reviews that converged
  without seeing each other's answers. Noted for the record: Grok's
  review was primed with ChatGPT's opinion first, so it doesn't count as
  independent corroboration despite agreeing — flagged as a live example
  of the exact independence-vs-correlation problem this section is about.
  Applied: one wording sharpening in §12.3 (explicit three-link chain,
  independence≠truth) per convergent recommendation; §12 Status line
  updated to distinguish "provisionally accepted, operationally unclosed"
  from "unfinished." CIS not self-certified — routed to a narrow
  Skeptic/Auditor pass on the classification question only. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-12: **CIS Track A classification independently confirmed —
  one of ADP's two ratification blockers resolved.** Narrow
  Skeptic/Auditor pass verified both cited axioms (P-4, Q-2) word-for-
  word against `Governance_Charter.md` before accepting the analysis,
  not trusted on restatement. Reached Track A independently, naming a
  residual interpretive ambiguity honestly rather than glossing over it
  — judged not strong enough to flip the classification. GOV-021c remains
  the sole remaining ratification blocker, correctly held Open pending
  live evidence rather than closed on specification alone. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-12: **Continuity check for an anticipated new thread/instance —
  Progress_Log and Discovery.md both had real staleness, fixed.**
  Current Lessons hadn't been touched since 08-09 despite three
  significant incidents since (CIS section deletion/restoration,
  CLF-010/011 baseline reconciliation, Grok-priming non-independence
  catch) — rotated the two oldest entries to
  `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md`, added the two most
  load-bearing new ones (CIS deletion, Grok priming). Forward Growth
  Avenues (dated 2026-08-11) was silently superseded on its ADP items by
  today's work — added a dated update note pointing at current reality
  rather than rewriting the whole section. `Discovery.md`'s File
  Promotion Status table still showed ADP at "0/6, not yet audited" —
  actual state is 6/6, GOV-021b Resolved, CIS independently confirmed;
  fixed. Two other Discovery.md ADP mentions (structure tree, creation
  date) checked and left as-is — still literally accurate as high-level
  statements. README.md not touched — deliberately high-level narrative,
  not a live-status file, and Discovery.md already correctly redirects
  fresh readers to this file for current status. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-12 (second entry, same day): **Unknowns.md also had a real
  continuity gap, found when specifically asked to check it.** Its
  version header block had jammed the CLF-011 registration mid-paragraph
  into the v4.52 entry instead of giving it its own version line —
  violated the file's own "one version per entry, current-only in the
  live block" rule (already caught and fixed once before, 2026-08-11).
  Split cleanly: v4.52 migrated to `Unknowns_Changelog.md` intact, new
  v4.53 holds the CLF-011 registration alone. Also updated the GOV-021
  row, which was accurate but incomplete — it didn't mention the CIS
  Track A confirmation from earlier today, only GOV-021b's resolution.
  Both fixes are the same class of gap as the Progress_Log/Discovery.md
  ones from the entry above; checking "was there anything for X" turned
  out to be worth asking rather than assuming clean. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-12 (third entry, same day): **Forward Growth Avenues replaced
  with Grok's structured work map (Lane A/B/C/D/E), superseding the
  2026-08-11 version.** Full prior section preserved verbatim in
  `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md` rather than discarded. Spot-
  checked before adoption, not applied on trust: FN-001/FN-005 status
  (Critical, Open, both blocking network connection \u2014 confirmed exact
  match), SEC-007a/SEC-007b split (confirmed, 007b correctly shown
  blocked on 007a), and the approximate Active Index counts (~49
  Critical claimed, 48 found by direct count \u2014 close enough, self-
  labeled approximate). No fabrication found. New section is
  substantially more structured than what it replaces \u2014 explicit lanes
  distinguishing spec-draftable work from human-only decisions from
  evidence-blocked items, plus an explicit non-work list and a suggested
  session sequence. Human-directed.

  Human-directed.

- 2026-08-14: **Two real gaps caught in the delivered Alpha.02 upload,
  fixed before treating it as current.** (1) `Progress_Log_Changelog.md`
  was missing the "Superseded — Forward Growth Avenues (2026-08-11)"
  full-text backup, even though the live `Progress_Log.md` correctly
  showed the 2026-08-12 replacement — a genuine content-loss gap in the
  changelog specifically, not the live file. Restored verbatim from the
  original extraction saved when the replacement was first made. (2)
  `Archive/Astroid-miner/` (a fresh companion-repo zip snapshot, baked
  into this release) was a real fourth Archive/ category not covered by
  `Archive/README.md`'s stated three-category structure — same gap as
  the 2026-08-10 Transcripts/ reclassification. Documented as a fourth
  category rather than left implicit; confirmed no live doctrine file
  references the archived zip's path directly (cross-references are to
  individual Astroid-miner files by name, resolved externally). The
  session's own CLF-011 work (§4b contract, Gate_04/05/06 acknowledgment
  stubs, Unknowns.md v4.54) was verified independently and is sound —
  it correctly documents its own predecessor's fabrication (two prior
  summaries claimed this content already existed; it didn't) rather than
  building on an unverified claim. CLF-011 remains Open, as it should.
  Human-directed.

- 2026-08-18: **Ratification attempt on `Admin/CIR_Gov.md` redirected to a
  GOV-008 candidate audit; audit concluded the candidate is honest but
  physically unratifiable right now.** the human governing authority asked to begin CIR_Gov.md's
  ratification process to surface any conflicts. First conflict found
  immediately, before any content review: CIR_Gov.md's own Binding Status
  section states GOV-008 (minimum agent/hardware quorum, owned by
  `Governance_Charter.md`) must be drafted and ratified first, as a hard
  sequencing precondition — confirmed still accurate against `Unknowns.md`
  v4.65, where GOV-008 remains Open. Redirected to auditing the existing
  GOV-008 candidate at `Admin/Governance_Migration_Protocol.md` §VII
  (drafted 2026-07-31, extended §VII.8 2026-08-06) for ratifiability
  rather than treating the dual-CIR-document question as the next step —
  Grok and ChatGPT both independently converged on the same redirect.
  Audit covered authority framing, quorum definition (VII.1–VII.2),
  operational achievement criteria (VII.3), independence/diversity tests
  (VII.4), failure/escalation behavior (VII.5), bootstrap sequencing, and
  migration path (VII.7) — all sound, and VII.8 already correctly
  rejected a competing Grok/Copilot draft that would have recreated the
  colliding-GOV-008 incident already fixed once (2026-07-28, renamed
  CIR-001). **Conclusion: not a documentation gap.** §VII.6 states
  plainly that the Hardware/Runtime Diversity requirement (≥2 distinct
  physical hosts; logical-only separation is interim-only, not sufficient
  for v1) is "declarable, not achieved" — no second physical host exists
  anywhere in the repository's actual operating environment, consistent
  with the standing no-physical-equipment-yet constraint. GOV-008 cannot
  be ratified until that physical gap closes; no further prose pass
  changes this. CIR_Gov.md's ratification remains correctly blocked
  behind it. The dual-CIR-document authority question (CIR_Gov.md vs.
  `Computational_Institutional_Reasoning.md`) is deferred — the human governing authority is
  doing further reading before deciding that one. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-22: **EC-016, EC-008, EC-003, EC-009, EC-004 integrated (Resolved,
  pending Human Ratification); EC-005 ratified as existing text; Closure
  Event format corrected to conform to Auditor_Protocols.md's Unknown
  Closure Authority §.** Grok drafted all five specifications in one
  session; Claude source-verified every claim in every draft against
  actual repository content before integration — hierarchy tables, AP-006
  evidence system, Ownership doctrine, Escalation Protocol placeholder,
  Governance Failure Modes section, and the EC-005 humanitarian-framing
  clause all confirmed exact, no fabrication or overclaim found anywhere
  in the batch. `Unknowns.md` reached v4.73, Open Unknowns 14 → 8. The
  anti-sweep Mandatory Human Ratification trigger (closing more than
  three entries in one cycle) correctly applied — all six entries marked
  pending, none claimed ratified. **Gap found on follow-up, not by the
  verification pass itself:** the four integrated Closure Events used a
  short prose summary rather than Auditor_Protocols.md's own eight-element
  minimum format, omitting an explicit independence attestation and a
  recorded Verifier verdict — both present in every prior closure this
  repository has done. Per that section's own text this makes the events
  invalid, not just informal. Corrected same day: all four Closure Events
  (`Admin/Governance_Charter.md` EC-016; `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md`
  EC-008, EC-003/EC-009, EC-004) rewritten with explicit Proposer/Verifier
  identity, capacity, timestamp, verdict, and independence attestation.
  Also corrected: EC-007's sidecar had gone stale the moment EC-004
  closed — its Resolution Path still read "pending EC-004" with Last
  Reviewed at 2026-06-18, contradicting `Unknowns.md`'s own EC-004 entry,
  which already noted the dependency clearing. Updated to reflect both
  named dependencies (EC-001, EC-004) now resolved, EC-007 newly
  actionable, status correctly held at In Progress rather than
  auto-advanced. Progress_Log itself: no entry existed for any of this
  batch until directly asked — third occurrence of the same lag pattern
  (2026-08-14, 2026-08-21, now 2026-08-22); Forward Growth Avenues' Lane
  B list still referenced the undifferentiated "EC-003–007 cluster,"
  corrected to reflect EC-003/004/005 Resolved and EC-006/007 as the
  actual remaining Lane B members. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-22: **EC-003, EC-004, EC-005, EC-008, EC-009, EC-016 ratified by
  Human Governing Authority — full batch, including EC-005.** Same-day
  follow-up to the integration and Closure Event correction pass above.
  ChatGPT's external review caught one genuine remaining gap — five stale
  `Last Reviewed` dates (EC-003/004/005 still read 2026-05-04, EC-008/009
  still read 2026-06-18, unchanged since the original registration despite
  all being closed this session) — and one claim that no longer held: its
  proposed fix for an ambiguous "Open Unknowns: 8" header assumed the
  header didn't already distinguish substantively-open from
  pending-ratification entries, but the parenthetical naming those six
  items by name was already present from the prior correction pass.
  Adopted the genuine fix (five dates corrected to 2026-08-22) and the
  reformatting suggestion on its merits (clearer two-line-equivalent
  phrasing), not because the problem it described was real. All six
  sidecar Status fields changed Resolved/pending → **Ratified**; all four
  Closure Events' Human Ratification field completed with date and
  authority; EC-005's Resolution Path updated from "awaiting human
  confirmation" to the ratification record. `Unknowns.md` reached v4.74.
  Open Unknowns header in `Ethical_Constraints.md` reformatted to state
  8 substantively open (EC-006, EC-007, EC-010–EC-015) separately from
  the six now-ratified items, rather than folding both into one compound
  line. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-22: **EC-007 (Substrate Fail-Safe) integrated — Resolved,
  pending Human Ratification.** Newly actionable after EC-004's closure
  cleared its second dependency (see 2026-08-22 entry above). Drafted by
  Grok with T1–T4 mandatory-entry thresholds as explicit, locked-method
  Placeholders — `Tests/Field_Logs.md` is intake-only, no operational
  history exists to derive real numbers from yet, and Grok's own
  follow-up explicitly rejected inventing "derived" numbers from empty
  logs as the false-precision failure this repository's provenance
  discipline exists to prevent. Claude source-verified the full draft
  against live repository content before finalization; no discrepancy
  found. **Two-round Skeptic/Evidence pass, not treated as simple
  convergence:** round one produced a split verdict — one conditional
  pass requiring three amendments (T2 diagnostic-observation exception,
  T4 self-test diagnostic-only clarification, a narrow recovery-
  diagnostics carve-out from the operational halt so Exit conditions
  remain reachable rather than deadlocked), one unconditional pass that
  engaged only the first of the three points. The unconditional pass's
  silence on the other two was treated as an incomplete review, not as
  agreement that those points didn't matter. All three amendments made,
  plus a fourth (re-derivation trigger rephrased as eligibility rather
  than a forced mid-incident rewrite, since T1's own entry threshold and
  the recalibration trigger share the same number and could otherwise
  read as circular). Round two: both Grok and ChatGPT independently
  confirmed all points resolved, unconditional Pass, no further
  substantive changes recommended — genuine convergence this time, both
  reviews actually engaging with every point. Integrated as a new
  subsection after Governance Failure Modes in
  `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md`; EC-007 sidecar Status and Resolution
  Path updated; Open Unknowns header corrected 8 → 7 substantively open.
  `Unknowns.md` reached v4.75. Threshold values remain explicitly
  Placeholder and do not acquire implied empirical status through
  ratification — noted directly in the Closure Event text itself, not
  left implicit. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-22: **EC-007 (Substrate Fail-Safe) ratified by Human Governing
  Authority.** Same-day follow-up to the EC-007 integration above. Sidecar
  Status moved Resolved/pending → Ratified; Closure Event's Human
  Ratification field completed; Open Unknowns header consolidated to list
  EC-007 alongside the six other 2026-08-22 ratifications rather than as
  a separate pending line. `Unknowns.md` reached v4.76. This closes the
  full EC-series batch worked this session: EC-003, EC-004, EC-005,
  EC-007, EC-008, EC-009, EC-016 — seven Tier 1 unknowns drafted,
  source-verified, integrated, and ratified in one continuous working
  session, with EC-007 additionally carrying a genuine two-round
  Skeptic/Evidence disagreement that was resolved on the merits rather
  than averaged over. Threshold values (3, 10, 2, 50) in EC-007 remain
  explicitly Placeholder — ratification does not promote them to Measured
  or any other evidence tier; noted directly in the Closure Event text so
  a future reader can't mistake ratification for empirical calibration.
  Human-directed.

- 2026-08-22: **SEC-007a, SEC-009, SEC-002 integrated into
  `Admin/Security_Protocols.md` — Resolved, pending Human Ratification.**
  First non-EC-series campaign this session, same tractability-first
  approach applied to security/enforcement doctrine. Grok drafted all
  three; Claude source-verified every citation before finalization —
  Trust Boundary Declaration, III.4, EC-004's descent analogy, GOV-006,
  RIP-001 all confirmed exact. SEC-009 required a real correction: its
  first draft's D4 signal cited CF-001 as the source of a behavioral-
  divergence threshold, but CF-001 is hardware-watchdog containment, a
  different mechanism entirely; corrected to defer to the existing
  `Challenges/Emergence.md` EM-001 unknown instead of proposing a
  duplicate, with CF-001's own In-Progress/τ=50ms status corrected in
  the same pass after being found stale against `Unknowns.md`
  (`Architecture/Cognitive_Frameworks.md`'s CF-001 sidecar was itself
  fixed separately, same day). **Two-round Skeptic/Evidence pass, not
  simple convergence-on-first-read:** ChatGPT reviewed all three as a
  connected chain first — PASS on SEC-009 and SEC-007a, CONDITIONAL PASS
  on SEC-002 requiring one amendment (raising a SEC-009 signal confers
  no downstream investigation/clearance/revocation/re-admission
  authority, since SEC-009's D6 lets any party raise a signal). Amendment
  made. Grok then reviewed independently against the live repository
  state (correctly citing CF-001's corrected status, not a stale
  version) — unconditional PASS on all three, explicitly confirming the
  SEC-002 amendment closed the gap and that the SEC-009→SEC-002 handoff
  is 1:1 with no seam defects. Genuine convergence this time — contrast
  with EC-007's first Skeptic round, where one reviewer's silence on two
  of three points had to be caught and re-done. Integrated: SEC-007a
  placed after the Trust Boundary Declaration; SEC-009 and SEC-002 both
  placed expanding III.4 into one continuous detection→response chain.
  `Security_Protocols.md` Open Unknowns: 13 → 10 substantively open.
  `Unknowns.md` reached v4.77. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-22: **SEC-007a, SEC-009, SEC-002 ratified by Human Governing
  Authority.** Same-day follow-up to the Security_Protocols integration
  above. All three sidecar Status fields moved Resolved/pending →
  Ratified; all three Closure Events' Human Ratification field completed;
  `Security_Protocols.md`'s Open Unknowns header consolidated to list the
  three ratifications directly rather than as a separate pending line.
  `Unknowns.md` reached v4.78. This closes the full Security_Protocols
  campaign worked this session — three enforcement/constitutional
  unknowns drafted, source-verified, corrected once (SEC-009's D4
  reference to CF-001), reviewed through two independent Skeptic/Evidence
  rounds with genuine convergence, integrated, and ratified, mirroring
  the EC-series campaign's full cycle earlier in the session.
  Human-directed.

### 2026-09-03 — Dual integrity repair after ChatGPT REVISE/G6-BLOCKED audits of Governance_Charter.md and Governance_Migration_Protocol.md
Grok independently confirmed both ChatGPT audits (all primary findings held under source check). Applied surgical repairs only — no constitutional or migration architecture redesign:

**Governance_Charter.md**
- Added FROZEN markers to Tier 1 Axioms, Integrity Enforcement Architecture (GOV-003), and Repository Integrity Doctrine.
- Corrected two stale GOV-003 status references to post-2026-08-23 closure language (residual only SEC-007b).
- Corrected GOV-016 "not yet ratified" sentence.
- Replaced Checkpoint 5 "four-tier system" with current two-axis epistemic architecture language.
- Updated File State Last Audit / Auditor fields.

**Governance_Migration_Protocol.md**
- Normalized File State: kept Exploration/0/6 but added explicit clarification that individual subsections may be operative/Payment-via-Specification closed.
- Collapsed overloaded Last Audit field to clean record (prior narrative remains in Resolution Log).
- Added explicit Charter-precedence rule pending GMP-002.
- Added FROZEN markers to Two Migration Tracks, III.A state machine, EQD, ESG.
- Added subsection STATUS markers for §VI / §VII / §VIII.
- Updated Open Unknowns listing to name the eight items.

Human-directed. No new Unknowns opened. Ready for re-audit of these two files or next high-coupling targets.

### 2026-09-03 (second entry) — Security_Protocols.md state-synchronization repair after ChatGPT REVISE/G6-BLOCKED audit
Grok independently confirmed the ChatGPT findings (stale bottom Status block, SEC-009 pending references, PAT-001/002 drift, RIP-001 dependency language, missing FROZEN markers). Note: the reported duplicate Trust Boundary heading was not present in the live Alpha 10 file (only one heading exists). Applied surgical repairs only:

- Scope Boundary: SEC-009 marked Ratified.
- Human-Factors note: SEC-009 closed; SEC-008 remains open; EC-011 still open.
- PAT-001 Status → Ratified 2026-08-22; PAT-002 no longer "Blocked pending SEC-007a".
- RIP-001 references updated to distinguish resolved archival substrate from still-open SEC-008 mechanism.
- Bottom Version 0.8 / G1–G6 Status block replaced with explicit Current + Historical record.
- FROZEN markers added to Trust Boundary Declaration and SEC-007a resolution vehicle.
- File State Last Audit / Auditor updated.

No reopen of SEC-002, SEC-007a, or SEC-009. No new Unknowns. No artificial Spec Gates advancement. Human-directed.
