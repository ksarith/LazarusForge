## Purpose

Created 2026-08-09 to fix a recurring failure mode found the same day, in two places at once: `Discovery.md` had a "Cross-Module Unknowns — Attention Required" table that was 19 versions stale (last refreshed at `Unknowns.md` v4.29 while the live file was at v4.48), and `Unknowns.md` itself had a "What v4.39 Means" section that had silently violated its own Size Management Rule 1 for nine consecutive version bumps — that rule requires the section to be retired and replaced every time a new version is cut, and nobody had been doing it. Both were narrative/progression content trapped inside structural index files, with no dedicated home and nothing forcing either to stay current.

**This file DOES:**
- Hold the rolling answer to "what did we just learn, what's currently open, what's next" — the thing `Unknowns.md`'s old "What vX.X Means" section tried to be, without a version number baked into the heading this time, so a new entry never requires renaming the section.
- Track recent completed work at a summary level, for continuity across sessions.

**This file does NOT:**
- Duplicate `Unknowns.md`'s Active Index — that remains the sole authoritative source for open unknowns; this file references IDs, never restates their full detail.
- Duplicate the five `*_Scope_Map.md` files' per-file scope content.
- Hold anything that belongs in a Resolution Log — file-specific change history stays in that file's own log, not here. This file is for cross-cutting lessons and session-level continuity, not a substitute for per-file logs.

**Size discipline, learned directly from what broke last time:** this section rotates. Keep the current entry plus the four most recent in full below; older entries move to `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md` in full, same split pattern already established for `Unknowns.md`/`Unknowns_Changelog.md`. No version number in any heading here — headings are dated, so nothing about adding a new entry ever requires editing an old one's title. This rotation rule was exercised for the first time the same day this file was created — see Resolution Log.

## Current Lessons

*(Most recent first. Rotate to `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md` once more than five entries accumulate.)*

### 2026-08-09 — A newly-fixed pattern can have a live instance sitting right next to it, unnoticed
Right after `Discovery.md`'s Rename Registry and Attention Required table were fixed for the "narrative content with no dedicated home" problem, that file's own five-entry correction-note history — sitting inline mid-file since 2026-07-04 — turned out to be exactly the same problem, one section over. Not caught independently; surfaced by direct human review of the delivered patch. Two lessons in one: fixing an instance of a pattern doesn't mean the search for other instances is done, and a second pair of eyes on a "complete" fix is still worth having, even from the person who didn't write the code.

### 2026-08-09 — Even this file's own creation caught a live instance of the pattern it exists to prevent
While retiring `Unknowns.md`'s stale "What vX.X Means" section, found that
its "keep only the current version in the main block" rule had itself been
unenforced for two versions — v4.46 and v4.47's full text were both still
sitting in the main block, never moved out when each was superseded,
duplicating content already safely in `Unknowns_Changelog.md`. Caught by
a routine post-edit verification pass, not by design. Same lesson as the
entry directly below, one level more recursive: a rule stated once is not
a rule enforced continuously, even in the file created specifically to
track that problem.

### 2026-08-09 — Progression content trapped in structural files goes stale in both directions
Two failures found the same day, from opposite ends of the same problem: `Discovery.md`'s shadow index of `Unknowns.md` (19 versions stale, nobody refreshing it) and `Unknowns.md`'s own "What vX.X Means" section (stale by nine version bumps, silently violating its own stated rule). Neither was caught by any audit pass in between — both were only found when directly asked to check whether Discovery.md content should migrate elsewhere. The general lesson: a rule that says "update this when X happens" is not the same as X reliably triggering the update. This file exists as the standing fix — one place, checked routinely, rather than duplicated content nobody remembers to touch.

### 2026-08-08 — Routing.md can diverge from reality without anyone noticing, even across sessions
`Routing.md`'s live GitHub state was stuck at 2026-06-06 (35 entries), while a local working copy contained a much larger, more detailed version (139 lines, 89 entries, a specific bug-fix narrative) describing work that never actually happened on the real file. The false version was detected and initially misattributed to the human collaborator's own diligence, rather than questioned — caught only because the human directly said "it shouldn't have the updates" and asked for a re-check. Lesson: a file matching expectations is not the same as a file being verified against its real source; local/session state can drift from the actual repository silently, and the fix is checking the live source directly, not trusting a prior description of it — including one's own.

### 2026-08-07/08 — A single ownership reassignment can leave stale pointers scattered across files that never cross-check each other
UNK-008's ownership moved to `Architecture/Geck_forge_seed.md` on 2026-07-19. Three separate files (`Architecture/Forge_flow.md`, `Operations/Gate_05_Separation_Thermal.md`, `Operations/Gate_06_Fabrication.md`) still said "no owner assigned" or equivalent weeks later, found only once the five-folder `*_Scope_Map.md` build put every file's cross-references in one place for the first time. No single file's own audit would have caught this — it only became visible in aggregate.

## Resolution Log

- 2026-08-10: **Discovery changelog migration integrated.** Installed
  `Archive/Logs/Discovery_Changelog.md` (PC-008 — correction-note history
  migrated out of Discovery.md); updated Discovery.md + Routing.md from
  migration package. Re-applied post-migration: Verification_Gates.md
  (not `_LF`); Admin tree `.md` suffixes + CIR_Gov/Autonomy entries;
  Archive/Logs list includes Progress_Log_Changelog + Discovery_Changelog;
  Routing Rename Registry pointer stays on `Archive/Rename_Registry.md`.
  Progress_Log gained lesson "newly-fixed pattern / live instance next
  door"; rotated 2026-08-06/07 blanket-Resolved lesson (already in
  changelog). Human-directed merge with conflict resolution against
  prior correction-pass state.

- 2026-08-10: **Facilities + Electronics pseudo-audits.** Same role limits.
  FA: Owner path prefixed `Architecture/Facilities.md`; FA-001 remains
  Critical/Blocking (physical site). EL: EL-005 Blocking No → Yes (PPE/
  scrubber sufficiency unknown per own Why It Matters). Open counts
  verified (FA 4, EL 9). Spec Gates unchanged (both 0/6). Findings
  F-FA-001–003, F-EL-001–004 in file Resolution Logs. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **Ethical_Constraints + Gate_02_Triage pseudo-audits.** Same
  role limits. EC: nav URLs → refs/heads/main; EC-010 Status → In Progress
  (aligned with ENV-003 vehicle + Unknowns.md). G2: TS-002 Blocking No →
  Yes (file's own highest-risk/operator-harm language + Unknowns index).
  No Spec Gate changes (EC 0/6, G2 2/6). No EC-*/TS-* closures. Open counts
  verified (EC 16, G2 7). Findings F-EC-001–003, F-G2-001–004 in file
  Resolution Logs. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **Energy.md pilot pseudo-audit.** Role: Skeptic/Auditor
  (read) + Synthesizer (minimal in-repo fixes). Corrections: EV-001
  Blocking `EC-002` → `ECN-002`; Safety Advisory session-relative language
  dated. Findings F-EN-001/002/003 logged in file Resolution Log (Spec
  Gates 1/6 soft evidence; Unknowns Priority vocabulary overload;
  EGL still proposed). No Spec Gate change. No EV-* closed. Confirmed
  Air_Scrubber Variant 0 cross-ref valid; Open Unknowns 5 = EV-001–005.
  Human-directed pilot of self-audit limits.

- 2026-08-09: **ChatGPT-pass reconciliation + RS-002 close + VG Track A +
  dual-file clarify + Unknowns sweep.** (1) Accepted clean AUDIT_HARNESS
  Rename Registry pointer; rewrote Engineer_Protocols and RIP pointers
  without ChatGPT's over-substitution errors. (2) RS-002 closed as accepted
  outlier (`Forge_flow.md` casing) — matches Rename Registry 2026-06-11
  resolution. (3) Track A: `Verification_Gates_LF.md` → `Verification_Gates.md`
  across entire tree; Rename Registry row added. (4) Engineering.md Rename
  Registry row corrected from "replaced by" to "spawned peer" —
  Mechanical_Structures.md is live peer, both Scope Boundaries agree.
  (5) Unknowns Priority/Blocking sweep: ~313 Open; Priority column mixes
  promo ranks (Critical/Major/Minor), Blocking, and High/Medium/Low —
  Canonical Terms distinguishes Operational vs Epistemic Blocking but the
  index column has no enforced vocabulary; empty Priority on Candidate/
  Deferred clusters and some long-form Status cells. Documented, not
  mass-rewritten (would invent doctrine). Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **Architecture question answered; Discovery tree hygiene only.**
  Explicit check: no architectural changes required by system doctrine.
  Six-folder structure (ASM-001) stable; CIR/CIR_Gov correctly Proposed–Not
  Ratified under Charter; no folder merge/split/new-domain trigger fired.
  Work limited to navigation integrity: Discovery structure tree missing
  `.md` suffixes on two Admin entries, omitted `CIR_Gov.md` and
  `Autonomy_Divergence_Protocol.md` (present in Maturity Snapshot but not
  tree), and omitted `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md`. Corrected
  against filesystem; correction note added. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **Scope Boundary closure + RS-002 framing.** Conforming
  Scope Boundary sections added to `Computational_Institutional_Reasoning.md`
  and `Nothingness_Theorem.md` (the two files flagged as missing any scope
  statement on Adm_Scope_Map creation); `Autonomy_Divergence_Protocol.md`'s
  narrative "## 2. Scope" normalized to the standard DOES/DOES NOT template.
  All three Adm_Scope_Map entries and the Gaps Exposed section updated —
  findings 1–3 closed. RS-002 (`Forge_flow.md` casing) reframed as
  "Awaiting human decision" after discovering an internal contradiction
  between Repository_Structure's PascalCase recommendation and the
  2026-06-11 resolution log / Rename Registry that already treated the
  current form as canonical; no rename performed. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **Post-migration pointer and registration-lag pass.** After
  integrating the Progress-Log migration package, residual "Discovery.md
  Rename Registry" pointers remained in `Routing.md`, `Admin/Canonical_Terms.md`
  (3 sites), and `Architecture/Forge_flow.md`. All corrected to
  `Archive/Rename_Registry.md`. Separately, RS-003 ("Archive/ directory not
  yet physically created") was still Open in both `Repository_Structure.md`
  and the `Unknowns.md` Active Index despite Archive/ having been present
  and populated for an extended period and RIP-001 having closed 2026-06-27.
  Closed on recognition; File State Open Unknowns count on
  `Repository_Structure.md` adjusted 3 → 2. Classic registration lag —
  physical condition satisfied long before the index caught up. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **Rotation rule exercised for the first time, same day as file
  creation.** Adding the "even this file's own creation caught a live
  instance" entry brought the total to six, past the stated five-entry
  cap. Oldest entry (2026-08-01/02) rotated to the new
  `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md`, verbatim, nothing altered.
  Also fixed while verifying this file: `Unknowns.md`'s main block was
  still carrying v4.46 and v4.47's full text after both had already been
  safely copied to `Unknowns_Changelog.md` — the "keep only current
  version" rule had gone unenforced across two version bumps. Removed
  the duplicates from `Unknowns.md` directly; nothing was lost, both
  versions were already intact in the changelog. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **File created.** Absorbs the function of `Unknowns.md`'s retired
  "What v4.39 Means" section (migrated as the fifth entry above) and replaces
  `Discovery.md`'s removed "Cross-Module Unknowns — Attention Required" table,
  which was deleted outright rather than migrated — `Unknowns.md`'s own Active
  Index with Priority/Blocking columns already serves that exact function
  without a shadow copy. See `Discovery.md` and `Unknowns.md`'s own Resolution
  Log / correction-note entries, same date, for the removal side of this
  change. Human-directed.
