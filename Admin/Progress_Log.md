### 2026-08-16 — GitHub MIT badge / classifier fix

Root `LICENSE` reduced to pure standard MIT body only (no appended NOTICE). Forge-specific interpretation moved to root `NOTICE`. `LICENSE.md` is a short human pointer. GitHub was classifying the previous combined file as license key `other` / SPDX `NOASSERTION` because the classifier matches known templates and rejects extra text in `LICENSE`.


### 2026-08-16 — License boundary cleanup (release integrity)

Root MIT remains sole license for material under project control. Removed conflicting CC-BY-SA footer from `Admin/Nothingness_Theorem.md` (Option A — maximum propagation, no dual-license ambiguity). Added bare `LICENSE` alongside `LICENSE.md` for GitHub discoverability. NOTICE clarified: MIT covers copyrightable expression; not ownership of abstract ideas/methods; not trademarks or validation status.


### 2026-08-16 — Tag naming convention (Alpha release hygiene)

**Canonical Git tags** for the Alpha line: `V1Alpha.NN` (no dot after V1), e.g. `V1Alpha.03`, `V1Alpha.04`.  
Do not use `V1.Alpha.NN` for new tags. Archive zip filenames may keep human-readable forms (e.g. the pre-rename `LazarusForgeV0-1.Alpha.03`, or the current `LazarusForge-1.Alpha.04` convention going forward); Git tags stay machine-consistent. Historical tags already published are left as-is; new releases follow this rule.

## Purpose

Created 2026-08-09 to fix a recurring failure mode found the same day, in two places at once: `Discovery.md` had a "Cross-Module Unknowns — Attention Required" table that was 19 versions stale (last refreshed at `Unknowns.md` v4.29 while the live file was at v4.48), and `Unknowns.md` itself had a "What v4.39 Means" section that had silently violated its own Size Management Rule 1 for nine consecutive version bumps — that rule requires the section to be retired and replaced every time a new version is cut, and nobody had been doing it. Both were narrative/progression content trapped inside structural index files, with no dedicated home and nothing forcing either to stay current.

**This file DOES:**
- Hold the rolling answer to "what did we just learn, what's currently open, what's next" — the thing `Unknowns.md`'s old "What vX.X Means" section tried to be, without a version number baked into the heading this time, so a new entry never requires renaming the section.
- Track recent completed work at a summary level, for continuity across sessions.

**This file does NOT:**
- Duplicate `Unknowns.md`'s Active Index — that remains the sole authoritative source for open unknowns; this file references IDs, never restates their full detail.
- Duplicate the five `*_Scope_Map.md` files' per-file scope content.
- Hold anything that belongs in a Resolution Log — file-specific change history stays in that file's own log, not here. This file is for cross-cutting lessons and session-level continuity, not a substitute for per-file logs.

**Size discipline, learned directly from what broke last time:** this section rotates. Keep the current entry plus the four most recent in full below; older entries move to `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md` in full, same split pattern already established for `Unknowns.md`/`Unknowns_Changelog.md`. No version number in any heading here — headings are dated, so nothing about adding a new entry ever requires editing an old one's title. This rotation rule was exercised for the first time the same day this file was created — see Resolution Log.

---

## Current Lessons

*(Most recent first. Rotate to `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md` once more than five entries accumulate.)*

### 2026-08-21 — Five ratified closures sat unrecorded here for a full day
`Unknowns.md` reached v4.72 on 2026-08-21 carrying five closures
(AP-004, AP-024 on 2026-08-20; GOV-014, GOV-016, GOV-020 on 2026-08-20;
GOV-022 on 2026-08-21) with zero corresponding entries in this file.
Caught the same way as the 2026-08-14 entry below it — a session asking
"what's left" from outside, not this file's own rotation discipline
triggering on the ratifications. Same family, same root cause restated:
a file that exists to prevent progression content from going stale is
not itself exempt from going stale.

### 2026-08-21 — Two independent external "what's left" summaries both misstated GOV-022's status, one also misdirected effort toward a hardware-blocked item
Asked ChatGPT and Grok directly what work remained. Both listed GOV-022
as needing its Operating Principles subsection drafted; source
(`Unknowns.md` v4.72, `Admin/Governance_Charter.md` GOV table,
`Archive/Logs/Governance_Charter_Changelog.md` sidecar) shows it Resolved
and ratified the day before. One summary also named GOV-003 as a live
Critical target without checking that its own Resolution Path
(`Admin/Security_Protocols.md` Phase 3) is explicitly "Blocked by
[Phase] 1 and 2" and gated by SEC-ASM-003 on GOV-008 — the same
no-second-physical-host wall already blocking GOV-008 itself. Separately,
a source-verification pass on the six items the frozen 2026-08-14 Forward
Growth Avenues still listed as Lane A found four (TS-002, GI-002, GF-007,
CE-006) had already been advanced past Lane A by spec-depth passes on
2026-08-15, landing on genuine hardware/validation gaps not reflected in
that section's wording. Standing lesson reinforced twice in one session:
agent "what's left" summaries are candidate leads, never a source of
truth, and a Lane assignment written on one date does not stay accurate
after later sessions advance the underlying file.

### 2026-08-16 — Integrity incident log stood up (no more willy-nilly)

`Admin/Integrity_Incident_Log.md` created as the canonical append-only home for RIP integrity incidents. Major and Constitutional response steps in Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md now point here; Minor compound-drift (≥3 audits) also logs here. Ownership table implements RIP-007 minimum (Minor → detecting auditor; Major → human operator; Constitutional → human governing party only). File-local Resolution Logs remain for remediation detail; Progress_Log remains for continuity lessons; Field_Logs remains for physical/multi-agent evidence. Prior scattered incidents were not retroactively fabricated into the log. Routing + Adm_Scope_Map registered.

### 2026-08-16 — Priority 2 cross-reference debt classified (no files invented)

Integrity harness UNKNOWN references after Priority 1 (Resolution_Methodology routed; Auditor_Protocols templates at v0.37) classified into five bins. **No new doctrine files created** to silence the harness.

**1. Real active file → route / fix path (done or already routed)**
| Target | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `Admin/Resolution_Methodology.md` | Routed in Priority 1 |
| `Archive/Logs/AUDIT_HARNESS_CHANGELOG.md` | Live refs in Unknowns.md pointed at wrong `Admin/` path → corrected to Archive/Logs/ |
| `Archive/Logs/Forge_Audit_Kit_Changelog.md` | Same path correction |

**2. Renamed file → use Rename Registry (do not re-create old name)**
| Stale name | Canonical | Notes |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| `Verification_Gates_LF.md` | `Admin/Verification_Gates.md` | Rename Registry 2026-08-09; remaining hits are rename *history*, leave |
| `Forge_Network.md` / `Architecture/Forge_Network.md` | `Architecture/Forge_Net.md` | Historical log strings in Forge_Net itself |
| `Triage.md` | `Operations/Gate_02_Triage.md` | Via Component_Triage_System → Gate_02 |
| `energy_v0.md` class | `Operations/Energy.md` | Already registered |

**3. Historical / intentional nonexistent — do not create**
| Target | Classification |
|--------|----------------|
| `Operations/Waste_Handling.md` | **Intentionally not created** — Resolution_Methodology §2 / GR-003 pass chose GR-003 as owner instead of a third file. Citations that discuss the *decision not to create it* are correct. |
| `Operations/Leviathan.md` | Concept lives in `Tests/Leviathan_testing.md` + vision lineage; no Operations/Leviathan.md was ever a live doctrine file in this tree |
| `Operations/Metals.md` | Never created; metals handling is distributed (Gate_04/05, Chemistry, CLF) |
| `Architecture/Characterization.md` | Never created; characterization content lives in owning domain files |
| `Architecture/Chemistry_Electrochemistry.md` | Never split out; electrochemistry stays in Chemistry.md |
| `Architecture/Cognitive_Canonicalization.md` | Never created |
| `Architecture/Advanced_Engineering.md` / `Performance_Engineering.md` | Never created as peers |
| `Admin/Constitutional_Core.md` / `Statutory_Parameters.md` | CIR_Gov aspirational layer refs — not live files; do not invent under CIR |
| `Admin/Evidence_Management_System.md` | Never created; evidence doctrine is Verification_Gates + Field_Logs + Evidence Classification |
| `Admin/Integrity_Incident_Log.md` | Named in RIP but never stood up as a file; process gap, not a missing upload |
| `Admin/Test_Protocols.md` / `Tests/Verification_Methods.md` | Never created; coverage is Verification_Gates + Auditor_Protocols |
| `Rogue_unit_management.md` | Concept/name only; no file; Leviathan/ADP territory |
| `Challenges/Energy.md` | Superseded by `Challenges/Energy_Scarcity.md` |
| `Physical_Site_Requirements.md` | Folded into Facilities / FA-* unknowns |
| `Propulsion_Economy_isru/zero_g_fabrication.md` | Astroid-miner companion path, not Forge live tree |
| `filename.md` | Placeholder example string in Canonical_Terms — not a real ref |
| `Admin/Discovery.md` | Discovery.md is root, not under Admin/ |
| `GOV_RATIFICATION_LOG.md` | Not a file; ratification lives in Governance_Charter_Changelog |
| `Admin/ID_Scheme.md` | Transcript-only mention |

**4. Actual missing artifact → Unknown (not invented here)**
| Target | Disposition |
|--------|-------------|
| `Admin/Integrity_Incident_Log.md` | Process named by RIP without a file — candidate future Unknown or explicit "log lives in Progress_Log / sidecar" doctrine, not a silent create |
| None of the others warrant a new Unknown solely to satisfy the harness |

**5. Companion / external**
| Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|
| `Propulsion_Economy_isru/...` | Astroid-miner archive material; not Forge Routing scope |

**Rule reinforced:** harness UNKNOWN ≠ create file. Classify first.

### 2026-08-14 — A significant doctrine advance can land in Unknowns.md and Field_Logs while Progress_Log's Forward Growth Avenues stays frozen on the prior state
FN-001 (full 10-class Adversarial Challenge Battery) and FN-005 (PA-001–006 Provisional Spec) both reached spec-complete in the same session and were correctly recorded in `Unknowns.md` v4.55 and a new Second-Highest-Value Run section in `Tests/Field_Logs.md`. `Progress_Log.md`'s Forward Growth Avenues section, last written 2026-08-12, continued to list both as "Lane A — can start now" and kept them in the suggested work program. The file that exists specifically to prevent progression content from going stale was itself the lagging surface. Caught only when a new session explicitly asked what actions remained leveragable without hardware. Same family as every prior entry in this section: a rule that says "update this when X happens" is not the same as X reliably triggering the update.

### 2026-08-12 — Priming one reviewer with another's answer breaks independence even when the reasoning that comes back is sound
When gathering opinions on GOV-021c's decision packet, ChatGPT and Gemini each reviewed independently and converged without seeing each other's answer — genuine corroboration. Grok was primed with ChatGPT's opinion first; its agreement, though well-reasoned, could not be counted as a second independent data point and was flagged as such rather than tallied alongside the other two. Caught by noticing the priming itself, not by anything wrong in Grok's actual output. This is a live instance of the exact distinction `Autonomy_Divergence_Protocol.md` §12 exists to formalize: consensus (agents agree) is not the same as independent corroboration (agents agree *and* the basis for treating them as independent has been established) — the difference showed up in how opinions were gathered, not just in the protocol text.

### 2026-08-11/12 — An edit that replaces one section can silently delete an unrelated section sitting next to it, with the edit's own summary never mentioning it
A GOV-021c drafting pass deleted the entire Constitutional Impact Statement section from `Autonomy_Divergence_Protocol.md` — not disclosed anywhere in that pass's summary. Root cause: the Impact Statement and the section actually being replaced sat back-to-back between the same divider and header, and the edit's target boundary appears to have swallowed both. Caught only by diffing the delivered file directly against the last confirmed-good copy before accepting it, not by reading the summary. Restored verbatim before any other work continued. Same family as the 2026-08-09 entries below — a "complete" edit and a correct summary are not the same thing, and adjacent sections sharing a boundary are a specific, recurring risk worth checking for directly when reviewing any edit to a multi-section governance file.

### 2026-08-09 — A newly-fixed pattern can have a live instance sitting right next to it, unnoticed
Right after `Discovery.md`'s Rename Registry and Attention Required table were fixed for the "narrative content with no dedicated home" problem, that file's own five-entry correction-note history — sitting inline mid-file since 2026-07-04 — turned out to be exactly the same problem, one section over. Not caught independently; surfaced by direct human review of the delivered patch. Two lessons in one: fixing an instance of a pattern doesn't mean the search for other instances is done, and a second pair of eyes on a "complete" fix is still worth having, even from the person who didn't write the code.

### 2026-08-09 — Even this file's own creation caught a live instance of the pattern it exists to prevent
While retiring `Unknowns.md`'s stale "What vX.X Means" section, found that
its "keep only the current version in the main block" rule had itself been
unenforced for two versions — v4.46 and v4.47's full text were both still
sitting in the main block, never moved out when each was superseded,
duplicating content already safely in `Unknowns_Changelog.md`. Caught by
a routine post-edit verification pass, not by design. Same lesson as the
entry directly below, one level more recursive: a rule stated once is not
a rule enforced continuously, even in the file created specifically to
track that problem.

## Forward Growth Avenues (2026-08-21)

**Supersedes the 2026-08-14 version** (full prior text preserved in
`Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md`). Standing directive from the
human governing authority: prioritize unknown closure that does not depend
on real-world/hardware tests — infrastructure is the current limiting
factor, and work should not be queued against it. Lane-first structure
below exists specifically to make that filterable at a glance; Tier framing
dropped this pass in favor of it. Baseline: Alpha.06 (Unknowns v4.72). Every
item below was checked against its own sidecar this session, not against
either agent-summary source or the prior Forward Growth Avenues text.

### Lanes

| Lane | Meaning | Agent-usable? |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **A — Spec draft** | Payment-via-Specification depth possible without new hardware | Yes, with human review |
| **B — Human decision** | Architecture / constitution; unilateral agent close forbidden or empty | Human session |
| **C — Evidence** | Needs Field_Logs, hardware, or multi-agent run | Observation first |
| **D — Dependency-blocked** | Upstream unknown must move first | Track only |
| **E — Exploration hold / no fast path** | Valid Open; low leverage now, or resolution requires elapsed operational time by its own Resolution Path | Don't prioritize now |

### Lane A — verified this session, do next

- **PL-001** (Halogenated polymer contamination, `Operations/Plastics.md`, Critical, Open) — no spec-depth pass yet; genuine prose-only doctrine work available.
- **WA-002** (Hazardous fraction identification reliability, `Challenges/Waste.md`, Critical, Open) — same; doctrine chain sketch not yet written.
- **GOV-015** (Constitutional interpretation capture — aggregate drift by subordinate-doctrine volume, `Admin/Governance_Charter.md`, Critical, Blocking No) — Resolution Path is aggregate drift-detection specification; no hardware or field-data dependency found in sidecar.
- **GOV-018** (Governance fork reconciliation undefined, `Admin/Governance_Charter.md`, Critical, Blocking No) — Resolution Path is a new Track/procedure in `Admin/Governance_Migration_Protocol.md`; pure specification, explicitly "cheaper to design before a fork exists."

### Reclassified out of Lane A this session (were listed Lane A as of 2026-08-14; verified against sidecar 2026-08-21)

- **TS-002** → **Lane D.** 2026-08-15 spec-depth pass wrote the three-way Station 0 decontamination workflow; remaining gap is a numeric pass/fail decontamination standard, which depends on EC-014 (encapsulation standard) and GR-003 (disposal doctrine) — neither owned by this file.
- **GI-002** → **Lane C.** 2026-08-15 pass wrote discharge procedures by category; remains Open because the file's own promotion bar is "written and tested," and testing needs a first operational run.
- **GF-007** → **Lane C.** 2026-08-15 pass resolved FA-002 clearance radius via NFPA 51B; remaining piece needs validation the sidecar says "this session cannot produce."
- **CE-006** → **Lane C/D.** Quantitative scrubber chemistry and a vessel sketch exist; blocked on "no vessel built, AS-003 uncalibrated" — explicit hardware gap, same category as CLF-003.
- **GOV-003** → **Lane D** (new to this list). Resolution Path (`Admin/Security_Protocols.md` Phase 3) is "Blocked by [Phase] 1 and 2" and gated by SEC-ASM-003 on GOV-008 — chains directly into the same hardware wall as GOV-008 itself, one hop removed.
- **GOV-005** → **Lane E** (new to this list). Resolution Path states plainly: "No fast resolution path — requires operational time." Not a specification gap; do not attempt to close on prose.

### Lane B / C / D / E — carried forward from 2026-08-14, not reverified this session

SEC-007a (external root-of-trust definition or formal deferral —
SEC-007b blocked on this), ENV-009/FA-001 (site assessment or explicit
"no site yet" posture), EC-003–007 cluster, TR-001/ECN-002 — Lane B.
GOV-021c (spec accepted, held Open on purpose), GOV-008/HDL Tier 0–1
("declarable, not achieved"), CF-001/CF-002, FN-001/FN-005 (spec-
complete, Open solely for numeric threshold calibration — do not
re-list as Lane A) — Lane C. PYC-001/003/004, CLF-004 (blocked on
CE-006) — Lane D. EV-001, FL-001, CO-001, SC-002, CLF-003, SD-UNK-*,
SR-001, TF-001, HR-UNK-* — Lane E/Tier 3-equivalent. **Flag:** none of
these were checked against their own sidecars this session — treat as
inherited, not verified, until re-checked.

### Explicit non-work for now

Bulk pseudo-audits of remaining Admin files. Closing GOV-021c on
specification alone. Inventing numeric independence/correlation
thresholds or FN Battery/PA numeric cutoffs without Field_Logs data.
Spec Gate campaigns on Exploration files with empty Field_Logs.
Reopening CLF-010 or GOV-016/GOV-020/GOV-022 (Resolved — leave them).
Treating an agent "what's left" summary as source without checking the
sidecar first — this session found two live errors that would have
misdirected work if adopted as given. Re-listing TS-002/GI-002/GF-007/
CE-006 as "Lane A — can start now" (reclassified to C/D above,
2026-08-21). Working GOV-003 or GOV-005 as if their resolution paths
were specification-only.

### Suggested work program (next 3–5 sessions)

1. PL-001 + WA-002 doctrine drafting — Lane A
2. GOV-015 aggregate drift-detection specification draft — Lane A
3. GOV-018 fork-reconciliation procedure draft for
   `Admin/Governance_Migration_Protocol.md` — Lane A
4. Human packet: SEC-007a options + ENV-009/FA-001 posture (inherited
   from prior list, unchanged) — Lane B
5. Progress_Log continuity check after any further doctrine advance —
   this file has now demonstrated the same lag twice (2026-08-14,
   2026-08-21); worth deciding whether a standing trigger (e.g.
   "no unknown closes without a same-session Progress_Log entry") is
   worth ratifying as doctrine rather than relying on the next session
   to ask.

Parallel optional: any Lane B/C/D/E item above once actually reverified
against its own sidecar, rather than carried forward from 2026-08-14.

## Resolution Log

- 2026-08-20: **AP-004 (cross-auditor disagreement resolution) Resolved
  — Payment via Specification, ratified by the Human Governing Authority.** Grok proposed (with
  a self-produced Revision 1 addressing three amendments from a prior
  ChatGPT review); Grok again correctly declined to self-verify — second
  consecutive instance of that pattern; ChatGPT served as independent
  Verifier, Pass. Full Closure Event in
  `Archive/Logs/Auditor_Protocols_Logs.md`'s AP-004 sidecar entry. Four
  residuals (AP-004-R1–R4) remain open as non-blocking child notes.

- 2026-08-20: **AP-024 (human attestation provenance) Resolved —
  Payment via Specification, ratified by the Human Governing Authority.** ChatGPT proposed,
  Grok performed a pre-integration Skeptic/Evidence pass, Claude
  integrated with an added H0–H5 reconciliation note, and Copilot —
  first genuinely uninvolved Verifier used in this campaign, needed
  because ChatGPT/Grok/Claude were all entangled — independently
  verified, Pass. A separate Gemini response fabricated an entire
  alternate specification rather than reading the real one; identified
  and excluded from the ratification basis, not weighed as input. Full
  Closure Event in `Archive/Logs/Auditor_Protocols_Logs.md`'s AP-024
  sidecar entry. Five residuals (AP-024-R1–R5) remain open as
  non-blocking child notes.

- 2026-08-20: **GOV-014, GOV-016, GOV-020 (governance complexity
  ceiling, pruning doctrine, cost metric) all Resolved — Payment via
  Specification, ratified by the Human Governing Authority in one batch.** First unknowns
  closed under the AP-013 doctrine outside `Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md`.
  Grok proposed all three; ChatGPT independently verified all three
  together (Pass on GOV-014 and GOV-016; Pass on GOV-020 contingent on
  correcting a real arithmetic error — 29/83≈0.35 misdescribed as "well
  below" the 0.30 Watch threshold when it actually sits inside that
  band — corrected before ratification). Full Closure Events in
  `Archive/Logs/Governance_Charter_Changelog.md`'s GOV-014, GOV-016, and
  GOV-020 sidecar entries. Ten residuals across the three (GOV-014-R1–
  R3, GOV-016-R1–R3, GOV-020-R1–R4) remain open as non-blocking child
  notes.

- 2026-08-21: **GOV-022 (reversibility as cross-cutting operating
  principle) Resolved — Payment via Specification, ratified by the Human Governing Authority.**
  Fourth unknown closed in the GOV-014/016/020/022 wave, and the only
  one where Claude was Proposer rather than Grok — drafted directly at
  the human governing authority's request after the human governing authority asked whether Gate_03_Reduction.md
  already articulated reversibility well. Source investigation found
  the principle independently reinvented three times (Gate_03, the
  Discharge Procedure, the Epistemic Ledger) with zero cross-linking to
  each other or to Axiom P-1/Q-3 — evidence against the "reject as
  redundant" option both Grok and ChatGPT had initially favored.
  ChatGPT served as Verifier, Pass across eight dimensions, explicitly
  reversing its own prior recommendation once the investigation was
  available and asking that reversal be preserved as Lessons Learned
  rather than smoothed over. Full Closure Event in
  `Archive/Logs/Governance_Charter_Changelog.md`'s GOV-022 sidecar
  entry.

- 2026-08-21: **Progress_Log restructure — closure backlog recorded,
  Forward Growth Avenues rebuilt Lane-first, six candidate items
  reverified against source.** The five closures above were written
  into this log for the first time (see 2026-08-21 Current Lessons
  entry — they sat unrecorded across the 2026-08-20/21 ratification
  session). Two external "what's left" summaries (ChatGPT, Grok) were
  checked against source rather than adopted directly: found GOV-022
  already Resolved (both summaries described it as still needing
  drafting) and GOV-003 dependency-blocked on GOV-008 via
  `Admin/Security_Protocols.md` Phase 3 (one summary listed it as a
  live target). Forward Growth Avenues (2026-08-14) replaced with a
  2026-08-21 version restructured Lane-first per the human governing
  authority's standing directive to prioritize closure work not dependent
  on real-world/hardware tests; prior text preserved in
  `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md`. Six candidate items
  (TS-002, GI-002, GF-007, CE-006, GOV-003, GOV-005) verified against
  their own sidecars: four (TS-002, GI-002, GF-007, CE-006) had already
  advanced past Lane A into Lane C/D since 2026-08-15 and were not
  re-flagged by the frozen section; GOV-003 and GOV-005 confirmed
  Lane D/E respectively. Verified Lane A set: PL-001, WA-002, GOV-015,
  GOV-018. Current Lessons: two new entries added; two oldest 2026-08-09
  entries should be rotated to changelog (count was over 5). Last Reviewed
  → 2026-08-21. No unknowns created or closed by this entry itself —
  purely a continuity/lane-verification pass. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-14: **Progress_Log refresh after FN-001/FN-005 spec-complete bump.**
  Forward Growth Avenues (2026-08-12) replaced with 2026-08-14 version;
  prior text preserved in `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md`.
  Current Lessons: new entry on the continuity gap itself (this file lagged
  Unknowns v4.55 and the Field_Logs Second-Highest-Value Run); oldest
  2026-08-09 "Progression content trapped…" entry rotated to changelog.
  Last Reviewed → 2026-08-14. No unknowns created or closed. Verified
  against source before writing: FN-001/FN-005 remain Open (calibration
  only), CLF-011 remains Open with stubs present, GOV-021c still the sole
  ADP ratification blocker. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-12: **CLF-011 reconciled onto CLF-010-ratified baseline.** Prior Grok
  pass used pre-ratification tree (reported 10→11, CLF-010 Open) — incorrect
  starting point. Correct arithmetic: after CLF-010 Resolve, Open was 9; +CLF-011
  → **10**. `fir_class` rename applied here without reopening CLF-010. Human-directed.


- 2026-08-11: **GOV-021c specification draft** applied on Alpha10-updated4
  baseline (`Admin/Autonomy_Divergence_Protocol.md` §12). GOV-021b already
  Resolved in this tree; only GOV-021c remains open. Detection-only; EQD
  independence dimensions + FN-001 principles; no numeric thresholds;
  Astroid-miner 80–99% not adopted. Human-directed.


- 2026-08-11: **Forward Growth Avenues logged** (see section above). Post-~54
  pseudo-audit recommendation: shift primary effort from inventory audits to
  physical/multi-agent evidence (Field_Logs, Hardware Diversity Tier 0/1),
  human decisions on SEC-007a / ENV-009 / ADP ratification, and operational
  Blocking chains (LW-UNK-001/003, PYC-001/003/004, FN-001/005, TR-001/ECN-002).
  Bulk pseudo-audits deprioritized. Human-directed synthesis.

- 2026-08-10: **Claude-review follow-up batch applied.** (1) **AS-004
  Blocking No → Yes** — file’s own text (“blocks that calibration step”) vs
  field; same pattern as TS-002/EL-005/GI-002. (2) **SEC-007a** left Blocking
  No (constitutional; agent may not resolve unilaterally); deferred to
  Facilities.md §VII Deferred governance parameters + back-link from
  SEC-007a Resolution Path. (3) **Priority (Promo)** defined in
  `Admin/Canonical_Terms.md` — separates Unknowns.md promotion-blocking
  column from file-local operational Blocking; clarifies F-SC-003 and
  EV-001 false-positive desyncs. Human-directed (Claude draft, Grok apply).

- 2026-08-10: **Gate_04 + Gate_01 pseudo-audits.** Same limits. MG: Open
  Unknowns 8 match; no Blocking understatement. GI: Open Unknowns 7 match;

- 2026-08-10: **Gate_05 + Friction_Dynamics pseudo-audits.** Same limits. SC:
  Open Unknowns 9 = SC-001–009; SC-009 correctly nuanced; F-SC-003 later
  clarified as Priority (Promo) vs operational Blocking vocabulary (not a
  true desync). FD: Open Unknowns 4 = FD-001/002/003/005 (FD-004 Resolved).

  PL: Open Unknowns 5 = PL-001–005; PL-001 and PL-002 correctly Blocking Yes.
  CLF: Open Unknowns 10 = CLF-001–010; CLF-003/004 Critical correctly Open
  (CLF-004 blocked on CE-006); CLF-006/009 In Progress consistent. Spec Gates

  Open Unknowns 8 = CE-001–008; CE-003 and CE-006 correctly Blocking Yes.
  AS: Open Unknowns 4 = AS-001–004; AS-003 correctly Blocking Yes; AS-004

  Waters only). WS: Open Unknowns 4 = WS-001–004; removed stale “to be

  Human-directed.

- 2026-08-10: **Security_Protocols + Mechanical_Structures pseudo-audits.**
  Same limits. SEC: Open Unknowns 13 match; SEC-001 Blocking Yes correct;
  SEC-007a Critical + highest-order failure language vs Blocking No logged
  for human review (not auto-flipped — constitutional domain). ME: Open
  Unknowns 4 match; no Blocking understatement of operational-safety type.
  Spec Gates left locked (0/6 and 2/6). No SEC-*/ME-* closed. Findings in
  file Resolution Logs. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-10: **Engineering + Waste pseudo-audits.** Same role limits as
  Facilities/Electronics. EN: Open Unknowns 7 = EN-001–007; EN-001 correctly
  Blocking Yes/Critical (no understatement); Spec Gates left 3/6. WA: Open
  Unknowns 4 = WA-001–004; WA-002/WA-004 correctly Critical; removed stale
  “to be registered in Unknowns.md” note (already registered). No EN-*/WA-*
  closed. Findings F-EN-001–003, F-WA-001–003 in file Resolution Logs.
  Human-directed.

- 2026-08-10: **Rule 10 (AP-035) added to Auditor_Protocols.md.** External
  Pseudo-Audit Scope and Logging Destination. Triggered by a Gemini
  pseudo-audit that fabricated an Archive/ inventory count (claimed 7,
  actual 27) and proposed three unregistered unknown IDs in a freestanding
  "Systemic Unknowns Ledger." Claude correctly diagnosed the fabrication
  pattern (third instance of the same failure class after two prior
  Copilot incidents). Grok verified file counts and ID collision-check
  (AP-035 free), then applied the rule. Spec Gates and Open Unknowns
  count on Auditor_Protocols unchanged. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-10: **Integrity cleanup pass (post-Alpha inspection).** (1) Repaired
  six broken relative links that had existed in historical copies under
  `Archive/Logs/` (paths that resolved inside Archive/ instead of repo root);
  those two historical copies were then retired as pure duplicates of the
  live `Admin/Progress_Log.md` and `Archive/Rename_Registry.md`. (2) Added
  explicit Template Exemptions section to `Admin/File_Template.md` so future
  retrofit passes do not force the full template onto Archive/, root navigation
  surface, scope maps, changelogs, BATTERY_SEED, PROBE_INVOCATION, or
  Automation sources. (3) Applied standard Navigation Anchors only to
  non-exempt active doctrine files that were missing them (Auditor_Protocols,
  Canonical_Terms, Economics, Forge_Audit_Kit, Repository_Structure,
  Safety_Protocols, Precision). (4) Documented in `Routing.md` that the table
  is intentionally the *active operational* map and that Archive/ exclusion
  is by design, not drift. Zero broken relative links remaining; zero
  non-exempt files missing Navigation Anchors. Human-directed; deliberately
  small scope — no governance rewrite.

- 2026-08-10: **Discovery changelog migration integrated.** Installed
  `Archive/Logs/Discovery_Changelog.md` (PC-008 — correction-note history
  migrated out of Discovery.md); updated Discovery.md + Routing.md from
  migration package. Re-applied post-migration: Verification_Gates.md
  (not `_LF`); Admin tree `.md` suffixes + CIR_Gov/Autonomy entries;
  Archive/Logs list includes Progress_Log_Changelog + Discovery_Changelog;
  Routing Rename Registry pointer stays on `Archive/Rename_Registry.md`.
  Progress_Log gained lesson "newly-fixed pattern / live instance next
  door"; rotated 2026-08-06/07 blanket-Resolved lesson (already in
  changelog). Human-directed merge with conflict resolution against
  prior correction-pass state.

- 2026-08-10: **Facilities + Electronics pseudo-audits.** Same role limits.
  FA: Owner path prefixed `Architecture/Facilities.md`; FA-001 remains
  Critical/Blocking (physical site). EL: EL-005 Blocking No → Yes (PPE/
  scrubber sufficiency unknown per own Why It Matters). Open counts
  verified (FA 4, EL 9). Spec Gates unchanged (both 0/6). Findings
  F-FA-001–003, F-EL-001–004 in file Resolution Logs. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **Ethical_Constraints + Gate_02_Triage pseudo-audits.** Same
  role limits. EC: nav URLs → refs/heads/main; EC-010 Status → In Progress
  (aligned with ENV-003 vehicle + Unknowns.md). G2: TS-002 Blocking No →
  Yes (file's own highest-risk/operator-harm language + Unknowns index).
  No Spec Gate changes (EC 0/6, G2 2/6). No EC-*/TS-* closures. Open counts
  verified (EC 16, G2 7). Findings F-EC-001–003, F-G2-001–004 in file
  Resolution Logs. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **Energy.md pilot pseudo-audit.** Role: Skeptic/Auditor
  (read) + Synthesizer (minimal in-repo fixes). Corrections: EV-001
  Blocking `EC-002` → `ECN-002`; Safety Advisory session-relative language
  dated. Findings F-EN-001/002/003 logged in file Resolution Log (Spec
  Gates 1/6 soft evidence; Unknowns Priority vocabulary overload;
  EGL still proposed). No Spec Gate change. No EV-* closed. Confirmed
  Air_Scrubber Variant 0 cross-ref valid; Open Unknowns 5 = EV-001–005.
  Human-directed pilot of self-audit limits.

- 2026-08-09: **ChatGPT-pass reconciliation + RS-002 close + VG Track A +
  dual-file clarify + Unknowns sweep.** (1) Accepted clean AUDIT_HARNESS
  Rename Registry pointer; rewrote Engineer_Protocols and RIP pointers
  without ChatGPT's over-substitution errors. (2) RS-002 closed as accepted
  outlier (`Forge_flow.md` casing) — matches Rename Registry 2026-06-11
  resolution. (3) Track A: `Verification_Gates_LF.md` → `Verification_Gates.md`
  across entire tree; Rename Registry row added. (4) Engineering.md Rename
  Registry row corrected from "replaced by" to "spawned peer" —
  Mechanical_Structures.md is live peer, both Scope Boundaries agree.
  (5) Unknowns Priority/Blocking sweep: ~313 Open; Priority column mixes
  promo ranks (Critical/Major/Minor), Blocking, and High/Medium/Low —
  Canonical Terms distinguishes Operational vs Epistemic Blocking but the
  index column has no enforced vocabulary; empty Priority on Candidate/
  Deferred clusters and some long-form Status cells. Documented, not
  mass-rewritten (would invent doctrine). Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **Architecture question answered; Discovery tree hygiene only.**
  Explicit check: no architectural changes required by system doctrine.
  Six-folder structure (ASM-001) stable; CIR/CIR_Gov correctly Proposed–Not
  Ratified under Charter; no folder merge/split/new-domain trigger fired.
  Work limited to navigation integrity: Discovery structure tree missing
  `.md` suffixes on two Admin entries, omitted `CIR_Gov.md` and
  `Autonomy_Divergence_Protocol.md` (present in Maturity Snapshot but not
  tree), and omitted `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md`. Corrected
  against filesystem; correction note added. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **Scope Boundary closure + RS-002 framing.** Conforming
  Scope Boundary sections added to `Computational_Institutional_Reasoning.md`
  and `Nothingness_Theorem.md` (the two files flagged as missing any scope
  statement on Adm_Scope_Map creation); `Autonomy_Divergence_Protocol.md`'s
  narrative "## 2. Scope" normalized to the standard DOES/DOES NOT template.
  All three Adm_Scope_Map entries and the Gaps Exposed section updated —
  findings 1–3 closed. RS-002 (`Forge_flow.md` casing) reframed as
  "Awaiting human decision" after discovering an internal contradiction
  between Repository_Structure's PascalCase recommendation and the
  2026-06-11 resolution log / Rename Registry that already treated the
  current form as canonical; no rename performed. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **Post-migration pointer and registration-lag pass.** After
  integrating the Progress-Log migration package, residual "Discovery.md
  Rename Registry" pointers remained in `Routing.md`, `Admin/Canonical_Terms.md`
  (3 sites), and `Architecture/Forge_flow.md`. All corrected to
  `Archive/Rename_Registry.md`. Separately, RS-003 ("Archive/ directory not
  yet physically created") was still Open in both `Repository_Structure.md`
  and the `Unknowns.md` Active Index despite Archive/ having been present
  and populated for an extended period and RIP-001 having closed 2026-06-27.
  Closed on recognition; File State Open Unknowns count on
  `Repository_Structure.md` adjusted 3 → 2. Classic registration lag —
  physical condition satisfied long before the index caught up. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **Rotation rule exercised for the first time, same day as file
  creation.** Adding the "even this file's own creation caught a live
  instance" entry brought the total to six, past the stated five-entry
  cap. Oldest entry (2026-08-01/02) rotated to the new
  `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md`, verbatim, nothing altered.
  Also fixed while verifying this file: `Unknowns.md`'s main block was
  still carrying v4.46 and v4.47's full text after both had already been
  safely copied to `Unknowns_Changelog.md` — the "keep only current
  version" rule had gone unenforced across two version bumps. Removed
  the duplicates from `Unknowns.md` directly; nothing was lost, both
  versions were already intact in the changelog. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-09: **File created.** Absorbs the function of `Unknowns.md`'s retired
  "What v4.39 Means" section (migrated as the fifth entry above) and replaces
  `Discovery.md`'s removed "Cross-Module Unknowns — Attention Required" table,
  which was deleted outright rather than migrated — `Unknowns.md`'s own Active
  Index with Priority/Blocking columns already serves that exact function
  without a shadow copy. See `Discovery.md` and `Unknowns.md`'s own Resolution
  Log / correction-note entries, same date, for the removal side of this
  change. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-10: **Archive/ reclassified into Snapshots/Logs/Transcripts.** Human-
  directed downtime cleanup, separate from the pseudo-audit cycle. Archive/
  root's stated Purpose (file-version snapshots) never matched most of its
  actual contents (raw external-agent chat transcripts). (1) Deleted 3
  transcript files with zero inbound references anywhere in the repo
  (Quorum-Copilot.md, Grok-8Aug.md, ADP-Copilot.md). (2) Moved the 15
  remaining transcripts — all cited by name in Resolution Logs or doctrine
  files — to new `Archive/Transcripts/`; updated every citing reference
  (Routing.md, Auditor_Protocols.md, Ethical_Constraints.md,
  Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md, Closed_Loop_Feedstock.md, and
  Unknowns_Changelog.md) to the new path; zero dangling references remain.
  (3) Removed `ForgeFlowchart.png` (1.9MB, ~30% of repo size) — confirmed
  zero references anywhere in the repo before removal. (4) Rewrote
  `Archive/README.md`'s Purpose section to accurately describe all three
  subdirectories (root/Logs/Transcripts) instead of only the root's
  original, now-inaccurate, snapshot-only description. `Archive/Logs/` and
  `Archive/Rename_Registry.md` untouched. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **Automated morning report found running one push-cycle
  behind live state.** Grok's daily repository report (auto-run each
  morning against GitHub `main` via raw.githubusercontent.com) reported
  Routing.md at 111 entries / "Last updated 2026-08-09" and Unknowns.md at
  v4.48/2026-08-09, with no trace of 2026-08-10's work: Rule 10 (AP-035),
  the 40-pseudo-audit cycle (6 Blocking flips: TS-002, EL-005, GI-002,
  AS-004, FN-001, FN-005), or the Archive/ → Snapshots/Logs/Transcripts
  reclassification. Confirmed against local verified copy (Routing.md: 123
  entries, dated 2026-08-10; Rule 10 present in `Auditor_Protocols.md`) —
  the report's content was accurate for the state it actually read, just a
  full day stale relative to the push. No fabrication found; this is the
  same desync class as the 2026-07-27 six-week gap and the resurrected
  duplicate-file incident, just caught same-day this time because the
  report runs automatically every morning. **Standing caution:** verify
  the morning report's freshness (Routing.md's own "Last updated" string)
  against the last known local push date before treating its contents as
  current state. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **`Repository_Structure.md` updated to formalize Automation/
  (external ChatGPT review finding, verified before applying).** Section
  II's folder diagram and Decision Rules listed only six folders and had
  no rule for Automation/, though it exists physically (9 scripts) and is
  already treated as its own layer in both `Routing.md` and `Discovery.md`
  — those two were already correct; this file was the one lagging. Added
  Automation/ to the diagram plus a new Rule 8: infrastructure, not a
  seventh content domain, no `*_Scope_Map.md`, doctrine about automation
  still goes to Admin/ under Rule 1. Two other ChatGPT findings reviewed
  and not applied this pass: `Repository_Integrity_Protocol.md`'s
  historical Archive/Git-tag material is already properly dated within
  RIP-001's own Resolution Log entry (2026-06-27), not free-floating
  undated text — lower urgency than flagged. A parallel Gemini review
  (Vector 1) repeated two already-resolved claims as new top-priority
  work (CIR and Nothingness_Theorem missing Scope Boundary sections) —
  both checked and confirmed already present; not applied, since there
  was nothing to apply. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **EC-002 (Anti-Weaponization pattern-matching mechanism)
  resolved.** Human-directed request to close a specific Blocking unknown.
  Added a Pattern Recognition Annex to `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md`'s
  Anti-Weaponization Doctrine, built on the 2026-07-26-ratified
  intent/complicity principle: six pattern categories (stated harmful
  purpose, effect-first specification, anti-personnel targeting geometry,
  weapon-specific integration, concealment, circumvention of a prior
  refusal), a detection method hooked to `Operations/Gate_02_Triage.md`
  Station 0, false-positive handling scoped to incomplete specification
  with a one-round resolve-or-escalate rule, and a category-tagged
  escalation path into the Human Escalation Protocol. Plasma cutter
  paradox resolved as the worked example. EC-002 sidecar entry Open →
  Resolved; `Ethical_Constraints.md` Open Unknowns 16 → 15; version bumped
  0.11 → 0.14 (also correcting a stale Version field that had not tracked
  two prior bumps). `Unknowns.md` Active Index EC-002 row removed per Size
  Management Rule 2; `Unknowns_Changelog.md` given a new v4.49 entry.
  `Operations/Gate_02_Triage.md` ASM-006 updated in step — its Expiry
  Trigger had fired now that EC-002 has a defined mechanism; Confidence
  raised Low → Medium, not higher, since the Annex is unvalidated against
  live triage volume. Explicitly does not resolve EC-001 (confidence
  threshold) or EC-012 (telemetry spoofing) — both cross-referenced as
  separate, still-open dependencies. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **EC-001 (Confidence Threshold Doctrine) resolved.**
  Human-directed follow-on to EC-002's closure the same day. Added
  Confidence Threshold Doctrine to `Admin/Ethical_Constraints.md` Core
  Mandate, hooking `Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md` §AP-006's existing
  UNKNOWN/PROVISIONAL/VERIFIED epistemic-state machinery rather than
  inventing a new threshold system: High-Risk actions require VERIFIED,
  Medium/Low-Risk actions may proceed at PROVISIONAL with Analogous
  External or stronger provenance, UNKNOWN is never sufficient at any
  Risk level. Checked the Resolution Path's one-standard-vs-scale
  question directly: "confidently classified" and "reasonably bounded"
  were found live nowhere in the repository outside one archived Copilot
  transcript, narrowing the actual scope to defining "sufficient
  confidence" alone. Assessment method reuses AP-006's existing
  calibration table and AP-004 arbitration rather than a new dispute
  path. EC-001 sidecar Open → Resolved; `Ethical_Constraints.md` Open
  Unknowns 15 → 14, version 0.14 → 0.15. `Admin/Auditor_Protocols.md`
  §AP-006 given a light reverse cross-reference to EC-001 (logged in
  `Archive/Logs/Auditor_Protocols_Logs.md` v0.38, no doctrine content
  changed there). `Unknowns.md` Active Index EC-001 row removed per Size
  Management Rule 2; v4.50 entry added, v4.49 rotated to
  `Unknowns_Changelog.md`. Explicitly does not resolve LT-003 (autonomy
  architecture), EC-008 (inferred authorization), or EC-012 (telemetry
  spoofing) — all cross-referenced as separate, still-open dependencies.
  Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **Autonomy_Divergence_Protocol.md's first Skeptic/Auditor
  dual-pass run (Claude), triggered by a proposed ratification.** Result:
  5/6 Spec Gates PASSED, G5 (Cross-Reference Integrity) BLOCKED on three
  unqualified Astroid-miner filenames. Fixed same day: all 8 occurrences
  qualified with `[Astroid-miner]`, and a §6/§9 semantic-drift wording fix
  (Human-Reviewed tier menu now points at §9's formal Restoration
  Procedure instead of implying restoration happens from the menu
  directly). Ratification was explicitly **not** applied — deferred
  pending G5 re-verification, with GOV-021b and GOV-021c still Open.
  Cross-checked independent ChatGPT and Gemini reviews of the same audit
  run first: both engaged with the real question (is Exploration-stage
  incompleteness appropriately bounded rather than hidden) rather than
  fabricating findings; Copilot correctly declined to audit from harness
  output alone without the actual file text, rather than guessing — a
  clean instance of the discipline AP-035 was written to encourage.
  Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **G5 fix from the entry above was incomplete — corrected
  same day.** A follow-up Skeptic/Auditor pass (Claude) caught that the
  Resolution Log entry written to document the original G5 fix itself
  used bare backtick-wrapped filenames to describe the bug, re-tripping
  the exact harness check it was documenting as resolved. Confirmed by
  running `audit_lib.py`'s actual extraction regex directly against the
  file rather than trusting prose claims either way — this is the second
  time in this thread that verifying a claim by execution rather than
  reading caught something reading alone missed. Fixed: removed the
  remaining bare occurrences; re-ran the regex directly, zero bare
  matches remain. G5 is now genuinely resolved at the tooling level. Also
  applied from the same audit pass: EF-0.1 wording fix (two instances of
  "evidence the structure is sound" — an agent-convergence-as-verification
  framing EF-0.1 disqualifies — reworded to "corroborating design signal,
  not verification"), and a Semantic Drift clarification (File State now
  explains why Spec Gates/Governance ID are tracked ahead of formal
  Candidate-Spec promotion, rather than leaving that as an unexplained
  mismatch). **Not yet done:** the `[Astroid-miner]` bracket convention
  works only because of an undocumented substring-match exemption already
  in `audit_lib.py` — it isn't registered anywhere as a real convention
  (Routing.md, Discovery.md, Canonical_Terms.md). Worth formalizing before
  it's relied on again elsewhere. Ratification remains explicitly
  deferred — GOV-021b and GOV-021c still Open. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **G5 confirmed genuinely PASS — ran the real harness
  functions directly, not another manual replication.** Imported
  `parse_routing`, `extract_md_refs`, `check_cross_refs` straight from
  `Automation/audit_lib.py` and ran them against
  `Admin/Autonomy_Divergence_Protocol.md` using the local `Routing.md`
  (112 entries) and real `ALIASES` dict (18 entries) — bypassing only the
  network fetch, which pulls identical content. Zero findings. Spec Gates
  now 6/6. Registered the `[ExternalRepo]` convention in
  `Admin/Canonical_Terms.md` — caught and corrected a backwards mechanism
  description in my own first draft of that registration before it went
  into doctrine (verified by direct regex test, not assumption). Folded
  the EF-0.1 wording-fix tracking into GOV-021b's scope rather than
  leaving it as an unlogged loose end. Ratification remains correctly
  withheld pending GOV-021b/GOV-021c, which are now the only remaining
  blockers — gate and tooling status are fully resolved. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **GOV-021b Resolved — Grok's draft for §4 Detection Criteria
  applied after verification.** Checked before applying: AP-006's
  UNKNOWN/PROVISIONAL/VERIFIED states are real (confirmed in
  `Forge_Audit_Kit.md`) and EC-001's Confidence Threshold Doctrine matches
  the draft's description exactly — no invented machinery. Applied in
  full: 5 trigger categories, corroboration rules, 72h observation
  window, tier/epistemic-state mapping, entry thresholds, degraded-
  observation handling, and Watch exit conditions (4 paths) in §6. GOV-021c
  is now the sole remaining blocker on ratification, alongside the
  Constitutional Impact Statement still owed to
  `Governance_Migration_Protocol.md`. Also fixed while in `Unknowns.md`:
  the GOV-021 row was stale on a second, unrelated count — still claimed
  the ID itself was unregistered, though it was registered in the Charter
  sidecar back on 2026-07-27 (flagged as a known residual inconsistency
  several turns ago, fixed now rather than left open further). Caught and
  corrected my own process error while editing: initially left both the
  new v4.51 and the old v4.50 entries live in `Unknowns.md`'s header
  block, violating the file's own current-version-only rule; also found
  v4.50 had never actually been migrated to
  `Archive/Logs/Unknowns_Changelog.md` despite v4.49 already being
  properly migrated — added it there before removing it from the live
  file, so no history was lost. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **Data-loss caught and fixed: the Constitutional Impact
  Statement filed earlier today was silently deleted by Grok's GOV-021c
  editing pass, undisclosed in that pass's summary.** Verified by diffing
  against the last confirmed-good local copy before accepting the
  upload — zero matches anywhere in the file for the Impact Statement's
  actual content (P-4/Q-2 analysis, the counterfactual test, the
  checklist) after the GOV-021c pass, plus this file's own Progress_Log
  entry describing it was also gone. Likely cause: the Impact Statement
  section and the old §12 stub sat back-to-back between the same
  divider and the "Relationship to Prior Framing" header; the edit's
  target boundary appears to have swallowed both rather than just §12.
  Restored the full section verbatim, plus this entry, before doing
  anything else with the upload. GOV-021c's own content was verified
  separately and is being evaluated on its merits, unaffected by this
  fix. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-11: **First item ratified purely on documentation-completeness
  grounds: CLF-010 (Closed_Loop_Feedstock.md §4a).** Surveyed the whole
  repo for genuinely ready-to-ratify items before picking this one —
  checked CIR_Gov.md (explicitly sequenced behind GOV-008, which needs
  physical hardware not yet available — correctly stays Proposed) and
  confirmed ADP itself still has a real open blocker (GOV-021c) plus an
  Impact Statement needing independent review, not just acceptance.
  CLF-010's own text was the one candidate that explicitly said it
  needed no physical trial — a bookkeeping rule, not a numeric
  recalibration. Verified the actual proposal before ratifying: formula
  internally consistent, cited CT-011 real (not fabricated), gaming-
  surface countermeasure sound. Ratified in full: four-class FIR
  taxonomy (A/B/C/D) plus Class D Residency Cap. Open Unknowns 10 → 9;
  Unknowns.md updated to match. Flagged, not done: Gate_04/05/06
  `material_class` field implementation unverified; Discovery.md's FIR
  maturity notes not yet updated. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-12: **GOV-021c decision packet resolved — accepted as written,
  held Open pending live evidence; CIS routed to independent audit.**
  Checked against a five-point checklist plus the CIS's next step, cross-
  verified against independent ChatGPT and Gemini reviews that converged
  without seeing each other's answers. Noted for the record: Grok's
  review was primed with ChatGPT's opinion first, so it doesn't count as
  independent corroboration despite agreeing — flagged as a live example
  of the exact independence-vs-correlation problem this section is about.
  Applied: one wording sharpening in §12.3 (explicit three-link chain,
  independence≠truth) per convergent recommendation; §12 Status line
  updated to distinguish "provisionally accepted, operationally unclosed"
  from "unfinished." CIS not self-certified — routed to a narrow
  Skeptic/Auditor pass on the classification question only. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-12: **CIS Track A classification independently confirmed —
  one of ADP's two ratification blockers resolved.** Narrow
  Skeptic/Auditor pass verified both cited axioms (P-4, Q-2) word-for-
  word against `Governance_Charter.md` before accepting the analysis,
  not trusted on restatement. Reached Track A independently, naming a
  residual interpretive ambiguity honestly rather than glossing over it
  — judged not strong enough to flip the classification. GOV-021c remains
  the sole remaining ratification blocker, correctly held Open pending
  live evidence rather than closed on specification alone. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-12: **Continuity check for an anticipated new thread/instance —
  Progress_Log and Discovery.md both had real staleness, fixed.**
  Current Lessons hadn't been touched since 08-09 despite three
  significant incidents since (CIS section deletion/restoration,
  CLF-010/011 baseline reconciliation, Grok-priming non-independence
  catch) — rotated the two oldest entries to
  `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md`, added the two most
  load-bearing new ones (CIS deletion, Grok priming). Forward Growth
  Avenues (dated 2026-08-11) was silently superseded on its ADP items by
  today's work — added a dated update note pointing at current reality
  rather than rewriting the whole section. `Discovery.md`'s File
  Promotion Status table still showed ADP at "0/6, not yet audited" —
  actual state is 6/6, GOV-021b Resolved, CIS independently confirmed;
  fixed. Two other Discovery.md ADP mentions (structure tree, creation
  date) checked and left as-is — still literally accurate as high-level
  statements. README.md not touched — deliberately high-level narrative,
  not a live-status file, and Discovery.md already correctly redirects
  fresh readers to this file for current status. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-12 (second entry, same day): **Unknowns.md also had a real
  continuity gap, found when specifically asked to check it.** Its
  version header block had jammed the CLF-011 registration mid-paragraph
  into the v4.52 entry instead of giving it its own version line —
  violated the file's own "one version per entry, current-only in the
  live block" rule (already caught and fixed once before, 2026-08-11).
  Split cleanly: v4.52 migrated to `Unknowns_Changelog.md` intact, new
  v4.53 holds the CLF-011 registration alone. Also updated the GOV-021
  row, which was accurate but incomplete — it didn't mention the CIS
  Track A confirmation from earlier today, only GOV-021b's resolution.
  Both fixes are the same class of gap as the Progress_Log/Discovery.md
  ones from the entry above; checking "was there anything for X" turned
  out to be worth asking rather than assuming clean. Human-directed.

- 2026-08-12 (third entry, same day): **Forward Growth Avenues replaced
  with Grok's structured work map (Lane A/B/C/D/E), superseding the
  2026-08-11 version.** Full prior section preserved verbatim in
  `Archive/Logs/Progress_Log_Changelog.md` rather than discarded. Spot-
  checked before adoption, not applied on trust: FN-001/FN-005 status
  (Critical, Open, both blocking network connection \u2014 confirmed exact
  match), SEC-007a/SEC-007b split (confirmed, 007b correctly shown
  blocked on 007a), and the approximate Active Index counts (~49
  Critical claimed, 48 found by direct count \u2014 close enough, self-
  labeled approximate). No fabrication found. New section is
  substantially more structured than what it replaces \u2014 explicit lanes
  distinguishing spec-draftable work from human-only decisions from
  evidence-blocked items, plus an explicit non-work list and a suggested
  session sequence. Human-directed.

  Human-directed.

- 2026-08-14: **Two real gaps caught in the delivered Alpha.02 upload,
  fixed before treating it as current.** (1) `Progress_Log_Changelog.md`
  was missing the "Superseded — Forward Growth Avenues (2026-08-11)"
  full-text backup, even though the live `Progress_Log.md` correctly
  showed the 2026-08-12 replacement — a genuine content-loss gap in the
  changelog specifically, not the live file. Restored verbatim from the
  original extraction saved when the replacement was first made. (2)
  `Archive/Astroid-miner/` (a fresh companion-repo zip snapshot, baked
  into this release) was a real fourth Archive/ category not covered by
  `Archive/README.md`'s stated three-category structure — same gap as
  the 2026-08-10 Transcripts/ reclassification. Documented as a fourth
  category rather than left implicit; confirmed no live doctrine file
  references the archived zip's path directly (cross-references are to
  individual Astroid-miner files by name, resolved externally). The
  session's own CLF-011 work (§4b contract, Gate_04/05/06 acknowledgment
  stubs, Unknowns.md v4.54) was verified independently and is sound —
  it correctly documents its own predecessor's fabrication (two prior
  summaries claimed this content already existed; it didn't) rather than
  building on an unverified claim. CLF-011 remains Open, as it should.
  Human-directed.

- 2026-08-18: **Ratification attempt on `Admin/CIR_Gov.md` redirected to a
  GOV-008 candidate audit; audit concluded the candidate is honest but
  physically unratifiable right now.** the human governing authority asked to begin CIR_Gov.md's
  ratification process to surface any conflicts. First conflict found
  immediately, before any content review: CIR_Gov.md's own Binding Status
  section states GOV-008 (minimum agent/hardware quorum, owned by
  `Governance_Charter.md`) must be drafted and ratified first, as a hard
  sequencing precondition — confirmed still accurate against `Unknowns.md`
  v4.65, where GOV-008 remains Open. Redirected to auditing the existing
  GOV-008 candidate at `Admin/Governance_Migration_Protocol.md` §VII
  (drafted 2026-07-31, extended §VII.8 2026-08-06) for ratifiability
  rather than treating the dual-CIR-document question as the next step —
  Grok and ChatGPT both independently converged on the same redirect.
  Audit covered authority framing, quorum definition (VII.1–VII.2),
  operational achievement criteria (VII.3), independence/diversity tests
  (VII.4), failure/escalation behavior (VII.5), bootstrap sequencing, and
  migration path (VII.7) — all sound, and VII.8 already correctly
  rejected a competing Grok/Copilot draft that would have recreated the
  colliding-GOV-008 incident already fixed once (2026-07-28, renamed
  CIR-001). **Conclusion: not a documentation gap.** §VII.6 states
  plainly that the Hardware/Runtime Diversity requirement (≥2 distinct
  physical hosts; logical-only separation is interim-only, not sufficient
  for v1) is "declarable, not achieved" — no second physical host exists
  anywhere in the repository's actual operating environment, consistent
  with the standing no-physical-equipment-yet constraint. GOV-008 cannot
  be ratified until that physical gap closes; no further prose pass
  changes this. CIR_Gov.md's ratification remains correctly blocked
  behind it. The dual-CIR-document authority question (CIR_Gov.md vs.
  `Computational_Institutional_Reasoning.md`) is deferred — the human governing authority is
  doing further reading before deciding that one. Human-directed.
